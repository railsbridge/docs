== Build and deploy a web application ==
We will build a web application for people to create topics and vote on them.  Ultimately, we'll have registration and authentication and a variety of other features.  Today we'll focus on building the core features of topics and votes.

Here is the UI design for the application:

[[File:Suggestotron_topics_index.jpg]]

=== Let's build a web application ===
* Open the terminal or command line
* Create a folder for our programming stuff
<code>
  mkdir rubyonrails
</code>
* Change into that directory
<code>
  cd rubyonrails
</code>
* Create a new web application!
'''Mac and Linux users type:'''
<code>
 curl -O https://raw.github.com/gist/1143443/f4db3f9aa41ebb0726b98fe783e01f02e0f5ba09/workshop_template.txt
 rails new suggestotron -m workshop_template.txt
</code>
'''Windows users type:'''
<code>
 rails new suggestotron -Tm http://ram9.cc/863314.txt
</code>

IF you don't have curl installed then click on the link, download the txt file, save it locally and then instead of the above command do the following command:
<code>
 rails new suggestotron -m workshop_template.txt
</code>

Everything you need for your application is now in the <b>suggestotron</b> folder.  If you decide you don't like it, just delete it and start over with the <code>rails new</code> command.

The -T option (T for Test) is a shortcut to tell the rails command to not use Test::Unit because we will be using RSpec instead.
The -m option (m for teMplate) is a shortcut for a few commands (listed [http://gist.github.com/609269.txt here]). Mostly it sets up cucumber features and installs the gems you need to run them. 

Normally, you probably wouldn't use a template. Eventually though you might create your own template with your frequently used options.  

<b>Next step:</b> Go to your new folder: 
<code>
 cd suggestotron
</code>

To see what the rails command created for you, type the following:
<code>
 ls
</code>
(That's a lower-case L, for "list.")

<code>rails new</code> created the following files and subdirectories within it:

{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" align="center"
! File/Folder

|}

=== Set up your web application ===
If you haven't already, change to the suggestotron directory by typing:
<code>
 cd suggestotron
</code>

Run the web app server:
<code>
 rails server
</code>

Windows 7 Users: 
If you get an <tt>Invalid gemspec in c:/...mingw32.gemspec]: invalid date format in specification: "2011-08-20 00:00:00.000000000z"</tt> error: 
# Open the <tt>.gemspec</tt> file for editing. The path/filename is reported in the error message.
# Remove the time portion <tt>00:00:00.000000z</tt> of the date field in the .gemspec file.
# Save the changes and relaunch the <tt>rails server</tt>.

Point your web browser to [http://localhost:3000 http://localhost:3000]. See your web app actually there!

== Make it your own ==
* Start Komodo Edit
* Project -> New Project...
* Select your new "suggestotron" directory
* Name the project file "suggestotron.komodoproject"

If you don't see a list of files and folders to the left, then go to:
* View -> Tabs & Sidebars -> Projects

==== Edit index page ====
The page you are seeing at http://localhost:3000 is a static page, located at <code>public/index.html</code>.

Make a change, save, and reload your browser to see it!

=== Awesome! Let's ship it! ===
From your new "suggestotron" directory, create a local git repository:

<code><pre>
git init
</pre></code>

This tells git that we want to start tracking the changes to this directory.

=== A little note about gitignore ===

Whenever we commit a project, git tracks every file by default. There are, however, files that we'd rather leave untracked (or, ignored). 
There is a hidden file in your app called "gitignore" that has a period as its first character in its filename to hide it from your normal directory view (this is why you didn't see it if you looked at your directory list earlier)
The entries in the "gitignore" file tell git what to avoid when tracking the changes of our project files.

If you open the ".gitignore" file, you'll see this:
<code><pre>
.bundle
db/*.sqlite3
log/*.log
tmp/**/*
</pre></code>

=== Making the first commit ===

After we've done that, we can proceed with our first commit by entering the following lines into the terminal:
<code><pre>
git add .
git commit -m "basic web application"
</pre></code>

This saves a snapshot of the application to git. Let's check to make sure that everything was committed.

<code>
  git status
  git log
</code>

<code>git status</code> tells you whether you've made changes that haven't been saved in git. Currently it should show you something like this:
<code> 
 # On branch master
 nothing to commit (working directory clean)
</code>

<code>git log</code> shows you a history of all your commits. You should see one entry - the commit you just made.

To exit <code>git log</code>, hit the letter 'q'.

Once you've checked that, it's time to deploy to Heroku!
<code><pre>
heroku create
git push heroku master
</pre></code>

Notice the URL that heroku reports after you typed "heroku create."  Type this URL in your browser to see your application on the web.  If you don't want to do that, the command <code>heroku open</code> does this for you by opening the browser.

== A Closer Look at the Features ==
* '''If you are using rails 3.1.0''' or greater and you get a postgresql error after pushing to heroku, then add the following to your Gemfile so that Rails can work with heroku:

<code><pre>
group :production do
  gem 'therubyracer-heroku', '0.8.1.pre3'
  gem 'pg'
end
</pre></code>

* Then in your terminal, type the following commands:

<code><pre>
bundle install --without production
git add .
git commit -m "heroku postgresql workaround"
git push heroku master
</pre></code>

* '''Windows Users! As of December 5, 2010''', there is a bug in cucumber that prevents the test from running properly. To fix this, open up '''features/support/env.rb''' and comment out line 19. (require 'cucumber/rails/capybara_javascript_emulation' # Lets you click links with onclick javascript handlers without using @culerity or @javascript)

* First time project setup in Windows 7, execute these two commands: (this appears to eliminate the bug referenced above)  If prompted, select "a" for overwrite "all".

<pre>     bundle install
     rails generate cucumber:install --rspec --capybara</pre>


In the <code>/features</code> directory are several files that end in <code>.feature</code>. These are cucumber features that describe the application we're building.

You can find the first piece of the app that we'll build in <code>features/1_topics.feature</code>:
<code><pre>
Feature: Topics
  In order to see a list of potential topics for meetings
  people need to be able to create and edit them

  Scenario: Getting to the new topic page
    When I go to the topics page
    And I follow "New Topic"
    Then I should see a "Create" button
</pre></code>

It's got several "scenarios" in the file. You can run all the scenarios in topics.feature like this: 

<code>rake cucumber FEATURE=features/1_topics.feature</code>

NOTE: 
* For some OS X users, this may cause a test failure due to a Lib2XML conflict, which can be resolved by commenting out Line 19 in the features/support/env.rb file: # require 'cucumber/rails/capybara_javascript_emulation' 
* if you get this error: "no such file to load -- cucumber/rails/active_record (LoadError)", please update your Gemfile, by replacing a line that mentions "cucumber-rails" with:

  gem 'cucumber-rails', :git => 'git://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails.git'

Then re-run "bundle install" and "rails generate cucumber:install --rspec --capybara" (select "a" for overwrite all").

=====Once you've run it=====
Once you are able to run it, the first thing you'll notice is that it fails! That's '''good''', because we haven't written any code yet. 

These features are tests as well as documentation. The typical Rails workflow is:
# run the test
# watch it fail
# implement the feature
# run the test again to see if it passes.
 
This is the workflow we'll be using today.

<code>1_topics.feature</code> relies on some basic elements of a web app, which is what we'll build first. As we get features to pass, we'll look further at the features definitions to see what needs to be built.

== First Feature:  Adding topics ==

We can look through the features and screen shots and see how a topic is defined and how people expect to interact with it.  We will use rails "scaffolding" to generate some pages and code.
    
* topic will have a title and a description
* we will enable basic "CRUD" actions:
**'''C'''reate - enter a new topic
**'''R'''ead - see everyone's topics
**'''U'''pdate - change the topics you entered
**'''D'''elete - remove your topics from the system

=== Scaffolding ===

* Run this command line script to generate a Topic model along with the application logic and views:

    rails generate scaffold topic title:string description:text

* Holy generated files, Batman!

* Open the migration file (yours will have a different number): 

    db/migrate/20091014021209_create_topics.rb

It contains Ruby code to set up the database table.  Migrations can also be used for modifying tables (add/remove/rename columns) and even modifying data.

* Now let's set up our development and test databases by running the migration file:
<code>
    rake db:migrate
</code>

* Run the cucumber feature again (the first scenario should pass, but the second will fail)
<code>
    rake cucumber FEATURE=features/1_topics.feature
</code>

* If you want to just see the passing scenario, type this instead:
<code>
    rake cucumber FEATURE=features/1_topics.feature:5:8
</code>
This command tells cucumber to only run lines 5 through 8 in your story, which is currently passing our tests.

Now let's look at the feature we created by running the server locally.  
* Start your server:
<code>
    rails server
</code>

* And point your browser to [http://localhost:3000/topics http://localhost:3000/topics]

Congratulations!  You have built a web application that works with a relational database.

=== A Quick Look at Your Database ===
You can access the database directly on your local machine.  For this class we’re using SQLite, and we've installed SQLite Manager, a GUI tool that lets you inspect the database.  To open it, open Firefox, then select "Tools -> SQLite Manager."

Click the open folder icon [[File:Folder.jpg]] ￼ or choose '''Database -> Connect Database''' to open <code>suggestotron/db/development.sqlite3</code> 

Windows Users: You may have to change the file type selection field to "All Files" to be able to see files with the <code>sqlite3</code> file extension.

[[File:Sqllit.jpg]]

In SQLite, you can choose “Browse & Search” to interactively explore the database or “Execute SQL” to type SQL commands.

You can also access the database through the command line:

    rails dbconsole


{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center"
|+Common SQL Commands
!  
! sqlite
! MySql
! PosgreSQL

|- 
| list tables in current db
| .tables
| show tables;
| \d
|- 
| show SQL for table create list columns
| .schema
.schema topics
| show create table topics;
describe topics;
| \d topics
|- 
| exit command line tool
| .quit

|- 
| show number of rows
|  colspan="3" | select count(*) from topics;
 
|- 
| show matching record
|  colspan="3" | select * from topic where title = "My Topic";
|}

=== Deploy Your Application ===

Don’t forget, "commit early, deploy often."  Here's how:
<code><pre>
git add .
git commit -m "topic crud"
git push heroku master
heroku rake db:migrate
</pre></code>

If you run into error, '''uninitialized constant Rake::DSL''' then add following to your Rakefile: 
<code><pre>
require 'rake/dsl_definition'
require 'rake'
</pre></code>

Congratulations!  You have built '''and deployed''' a web application that  works with a relational database.


Rails implements a very specific notion of the '''Model-View-Controller''' pattern, which guides how you build a web application.

'''Model'''
* represents what is in the database
* ActiveRecord, ActiveModel

'''View'''
* the model rendered as HTML
* ActionView, erb

'''Controller'''
* receives HTTP actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* decides what to do, such as rendering a view
* ActionController

[[File:Mvc.jpg]]

[[File:Mvc-stickman.png]]

When you executed the <code>rails generate scaffold</code> command, Rails generated files that implement a model, some views, and a controller for topics.

'''The Model'''
* create app/models/topic.rb
* create db/migrate/20090611073227_create_topics.rb

'''Five Views'''
* create app/views/topics/_form.html.erb
* create app/views/topics/index.html.erb
* create app/views/topics/show.html.erb
* create app/views/topics/new.html.erb
* create app/views/topics/edit.html.erb

'''The Controller'''
* create app/controllers/topics_controller.rb
* route map.resources :topics

=== A closer look ===
Rails allows you to easily invoke an interactive console with all of the Rails libraries and your application code loaded:
<code><pre>
    rails console
</pre></code>

Let's add in some logging so that we can see what is happening in the database:
<code><pre>
ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
</pre></code>

Let’s open the console and look at the model that is defined here: <code>app/models/topic.rb</code>
<code><pre>
>> t = Topic.new
=> #<Topic id: nil, title: nil, description: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
>> t.title = "My topic"
=> "My topic"
>> t.description = "this is really cool"
=> "this is really cool"
>> t.save
</pre></code>

Notice that the Topic class has title and description attributes which you did not need to explicitly declare in the class.  This is handled by ActiveRecord which implements ORM (Object Relational Mapping) in Rails.

== Routes ==
Rails routes control how URLs map to code.  We can use <code>rake routes</code> to list the relationships between routes and controllers. 
<code><pre>
$ rake routes
    topics GET    /topics(.:format)          {:action=>"index", :controller=>"topics"}
    topics POST   /topics(.:format)          {:action=>"create", :controller=>"topics"}
 new_topic GET    /topics/new(.:format)      {:action=>"new", :controller=>"topics"}
edit_topic GET    /topics/:id/edit(.:format) {:action=>"edit", :controller=>"topics"}
     topic GET    /topics/:id(.:format)      {:action=>"show", :controller=>"topics"}
     topic PUT    /topics/:id(.:format)      {:action=>"update", :controller=>"topics"}
     topic DELETE /topics/:id(.:format)      {:action=>"destroy", :controller=>"topics"}

</pre></code>

Each method in the controller will take an HTTP request, usually find some data in the database (via an ActiveRecord model) and render a view or redirect to another action.

See [[Workshop_Diagrams]] to help trace the connections between HTTP, REST, routes, controllers, and databases.

=== How to explore your routes ===
Open up your rails console:
<code>
  rails console
</code>
Now you can have a look at the paths that are available in your app. Let's try looking at one of the topics routes we just generated.
<code>
 app.topics_path
 => "/topics" 
 app.topics_url
 => "http://www.example.com/topics" 
</code>

=== Remapping / ===

You can specify what Rails should route "/" to with the '''root''' method in routes.rb. You should put the root route near the end of the file, but before the final "end". 

    root :to => 'topics#index'

After adding the root route, your routes.rb file should look like this:

  Suggestotron::Application.routes.draw do
    resources :topics
    root :to => 'topics#index'
  end

You also need to delete the index.html file for the root route to work.

  git rm public/index.html

== Next feature: creating a topic ==

Let's run the feature again and see what the next scenario is.

    rake cucumber FEATURE=features/1_topics.feature

<code><pre>
  Scenario: Creating a topic
    Given I go to the topics page
    And I follow "New Topic"
    When I fill in "Title" with "Rails Fixtures"
    And I fill in "Description" with "Introduce how to add test data with fixtures."
    And I press "Create"
    Then I should see "Rails Fixtures"
    And I should be on the topics page
</pre></code>

Run the server (<code>rails server</code>), look at the app ([http://localhost:3000/topics/ http://localhost:3000/topics]), and see how the scaffold template differs from the desired application as we've described it above using cucumber.  What we want is the application to show the list of topics after the user creates a topic by completing the form.  However, the scaffold displays instead a page showing only the individual topic the user just created.

=== Controller: adjusting the flow of your application ===
We looked at the scaffold-generated code a little earlier. To change the behavior and make the feature act as desired, we will look more closely now at the controller, which controls the general flow of your application; for instance, which page is displayed when the user clicks a link or a button.

* Open <code>app/controllers/topics_controller.rb</code> and look at the <code>new</code> and <code>create</code> actions.

* Notice that in <code>create</code> there is a redirect to a single topic,
    format.html { redirect_to(@topic) }  
We want to redirect instead to the list of topics:
    format.html { redirect_to(topics_path) }  # <-- note no @

* As of December 5, 2010, there is a bug in cucumuber that prevents the test from running properly. To fix this, open up features/support/env.rb and comment out line 19 (if you haven't done that already).

* Now run your feature again with cucumber and it should pass
     rake cucumber FEATURE=features/1_topics.feature

=== Commit & Push ===
Congratulations! This is definitely a checkpoint. Time to commit to git and push your changes out to Heroku.
<code>
 git add .
 git commit -m "ZOMG first feature passes!!1!!11"
 git push heroku master
</code>

(Run ‘heroku rake db:migrate --app <app_name>’ to bring over changes in the migration files under Feature 1.)

== Next feature: the Topics page ==

Note that for this next set of feature scenarios we have a "Background" set of steps which will be executed before each scenario in the file. Since they depend on behavior that already works, they're rendered in green (pass). 

<code><pre>
  Scenario: Viewing a topic detail page
    When I go to the topics page
    And I follow "Rails Fixtures"
    Then I should see "Introduce how to add test data with fixtures."
    And I should not see "New Topic"
</pre></code>

* Run the scenario and watch it fail:
    rake cucumber FEATURE=features/2_topics_list_and_details.feature

* In the last scenario we made it so the app redirected to "topics_path" after create.  So, we expect that we will need to fix the error in that page.  We can use <code>rake routes</code> to find the controller action, then we can see that the default view is rendered.  The error is in <code>app/views/topics/index.html.erb</code>:  
     <td><%= link_to topic.title, topic %></td>

* Run the scenario again and see that the "Clicking on the topic title" passes, but we still have one failure which can be addressed in the same file
* Open <code>app/views/topics/index.html.erb</code> and change "Destroy" to "Delete".

=== Commit & Push ===
Another checkpoint! Time to commit to git and push your changes out to Heroku.
<code>
 git add .
 git commit -m "Topic titles are now links. for srs."
 git push heroku master
</code>

* '''If you're getting an error''' when you go to your Heroku application, run one more command

<pre>bundle exec rake assets:precompile</pre>

Be sure to commit your changes and push your changes to Heroku

== Next feature:  allow voting on a topic ==
<code><pre>
Feature: Votes
  In order to determine which talk to give
  people need to be able to vote for the ones they like
  
  Background: Make sure that we have a topic
    Given I go to the topics page
    And I follow "New Topic"
    And I fill in "Title" with "Rails Fixtures"
    And I fill in "Description" with "Introduce how to add test data with fixtures."
    And I press "Create"
    
  Scenario: viewing votes already cast
    When I go to the topics page
    Then I should see "0 votes"
    
  Scenario: voting on a topic
    When I go to the topics page
    And I follow "+1"
    Then I should see "1 vote"
</pre></code>

    rake cucumber FEATURE=features/3_votes.feature

=== How will we build this feature? ===

* Each vote will be an object (row in database table)
* When someone votes on a topic, we'll create a new vote object and save it
* Each vote is associated with a specific topic

=== Rails associations ===
    * Topic has_many :votes
    * Vote belongs_to :topic

[[File:Rails-associations.jpg]]

=== Add votes ===

We will use the resource generation script to create a model and controller (no views):

    rails generate resource vote topic_id:integer

And then we migrate

    rake db:migrate

The script creates files with:
* model (including migration, unit, fixture)
* controller (and route) with no code

Add code to to your models  to create the associations:
*<code>/app/models/topic.rb</code>
<code><pre>
 class Topic < ActiveRecord::Base
   has_many :votes
 end
</pre></code>
*<code>/app/models/vote.rb</code>
<code><pre>
 class Vote < ActiveRecord::Base
   belongs_to :topic
 end
</pre></code>

Check it out in <code>rails console</code>:

    >> t = Topic.new(:title => "My Topic")
    => #<Topic id: nil, title: "My Topic"), description: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
    >> t.votes
    => []
    >> t.votes.build
    => #<Vote id: nil, topic_id: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
    >> t.votes
    => [#<Vote id: nil, topic_id: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>]
    >> t.save
    => true
    >> t.votes
    => [#<Vote id: 2, topic_id: 2, created_at: "2010-02-22 01:42:27", updated_at: "2010-02-22 01:42:27">]

Now you can use it in your view (<code>/app/views/topics/index.html.erb</code>):

<code>
    <td><%= pluralize(topic.votes.length, "vote") %></td>
</code>

=== Allow people to vote ===
It's good to do one bit at a time and let the test failures drive what you do next. 

Check <code>rake routes</code> for figuring out the path<sup>''TODO: diagram or screenshot of where this info is on the rake output''</sup>, and edit your view (<code>/app/views/topics/index.html.erb</code>):

<code>	<td><%= link_to '+1', votes_path(:topic_id => topic.id), :method => :post %></td></code>

Now we need to create the controller action.  Open the Votes controller (<code>/app/controllers/votes_controller.rb</code>) to add the <code>create</code> action:
<code><pre>
class VotesController < ApplicationController
   def create
     topic = Topic.find(params[:topic_id])
     vote = topic.votes.build

     if vote.save
       flash[:notice] = 'Vote was successfully created.'
     else
       flash[:notice] = 'Sorry we could not count your vote.'
     end
     redirect_to(topics_path)
   end
 end
</pre></code>

Add flash notice to app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
<code><pre>
<p style="color:green"><%= flash[:notice] %></p>
</pre></code>
