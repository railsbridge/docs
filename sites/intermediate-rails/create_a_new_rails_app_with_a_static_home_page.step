* You should have a new rails app with with a static home page that's under your control. Make sure the controller for this page is called **HomeController**.
* You, the developer, should explain to a teacher, TA, or fellow student how Rails knows to render the home view.

discussion do
message <<-MARKDOWN
* In order to have a static home page, you will need a route, a controller, a view. Discuss!
  * Seriously. If you don't discuss this stuff, things will be SO much harder.
* We’re using `rails g resource` instead of `rails g scaffold` because it forces you, the developer, to do more understanding-building brain work. The teacher/TAs can perhaps comment on what they would do in the real world and their thoughts on the excellence of this choice for learning-purposes.
* What do you need to add to your home controller (after you've made it) to have a static home page?  
* How does the home/index.html.erb view file relate to the layouts/application.html.erb view file?
* What’s the significance of yield in the application view?
* What does the home controller do?

hints do
message <<-MARKDOWN
* You'll definitely want to delete the index.html that Rails provides. If you can't find it, ask your neighbor! 
* If you have no idea what to put in your home controller, maybe try looking back at a past-Railsbridge app? Or another rails app you have lying about?
