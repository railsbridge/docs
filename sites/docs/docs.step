# [Installfest](/installfest)

Instructions for installing Ruby and Rails on your computer. You are required to do this before going to a Rails workshop!

# [Curriculum](/curriculum)

The "classic" railsbridge curriculum (Suggestotron). Takes you step-by-step through making a Rails app, one command at a time, using helpers like `rails generate scaffold`.

# [Intermediate Rails](/intermediate-rails)

Curriculum for students who have taken Suggestotron more than once. 'Easy mode' is now OFF - this curriculum won't tell you what to type in!

# [Frontend](/frontend)

HTML + CSS for beginners. Make a website, no server required!

# [Ruby](/ruby)

A ruby-specific curriculum, expanded from the "Ruby for Beginners" slide deck. Still new, with room for your contributions.

Railsbridge workshops can also use Alex's [Learn To Code In Ruby](http://codelikethis.com/lessons/learn_to_code) curriculum (currently in a separate site). It's also open source and may soon join the main Railsbridge Docs repo. It's geared towards people who may never have written code before.

# [Workshop](/workshop)

The Railsbridge junkyard! Slide decks for opening/closing presentations, teacher training.

# RailsBridge curriculum-related FAQ

### Can I use the RailsBridge curricula at my event?
Anyone can use this site — it's very open source!

If you're organizing an event and wonder if it could be considered a RailsBridge Workshop, we just have two requests:

* The event should be free of charge.
* The event should work toward making tech more welcoming!

If you're not doing those two things, you can totally still use the site, we just ask that you not call your event a RailsBridge workshop.
(Charity workshops have used "Rails Workshop featuring the RailsBridge curriculum" in the past, which is neat.)

### I want to help, but I don't know how.
First, [make a GitHub account](https://github.com/). Then, [create an issue](https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/issues) with the idea you have. We'll help you turn it into reality (assuming it's in line with our lofty goals :D).

Don't know what you could work on? Browse the [issues list](https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/issues) and the [To Do list](https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/wiki/RailsBridge-To-Do-List). Those have lots of ideas.


### I have different question about RailsBridge.
The [RailsBridge website](http://www.railsbridge.org) probably has an answer!
