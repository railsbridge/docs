# RailsBridge Teacher Training

# RailsBridge Mission
Let's make tech more diverse and more welcoming!

### How?
* Workshops
* Bug Mashes
* Mentorship

# Introductions
### Who are you?
* Name
* What do you do for money? Who gives you that money?
* What's your favorite structure in the Bay Area?

# How to make your class awesome
Three buckets, lots of ways:
### Help people feel:
* socially comfortable
* technically capable
* like you know what's going on -- you're the leader. 

# DISCUSSION (Social Comfort)
## How can you help people feel	 socially comfortable? 

# OUR IDEAS (Socially Comfortable 1)
### Helping people feel socially comfortable:

### Introductions
* Definitely cover name, profession, why are you here, and something silly
  * Don't rush, even if you have a big class.
* If someone joins the class late, ask them to introduce themselves

### Icebreakers
* Help people learn each other's name -- admit upfront that no one is good at learning new names
* Get people talking. The more comfortable they are at talking, the more likely they'll speak up when they don't understand something, or to answer someone else's question

# OUR IDEAS (Socially Comfortable 2)
### Try to suppress your (understandable) culturally-influenced sexism
* Don't hit on people. No sexual advances. None. 
* Don't make sexist jokes. Or racist, classist, or ableist jokes while you're at it. Call people out if they do.
* Don't make gender-based generalizations ("Women are better at this task X, because ...")
* Don't treat women as delicate flowers, do treat them like normal people.
* Don't use slurs (bitch is a slur, btw).

# DISCUSSION (Technical Capability)
## How can you help people feel technically capable?

# OUR IDEAS (Technically Capable 1)
### Set the tone:
* Explain up front that even professional developers are constantly learning new technologies.
* Assure them that they will write crappy code, and that's ok. Everyone professional has written crappy code at some point. 
* Explain that mistakes are how we learn, and most mistakes seem silly in retrospect.  
* Before class, ask your TAs to ask questions if concepts don't seem clear.

### Explaining technical concepts:
* Avoid jargon and explain words when jargon is unavoidable.
* Assume anyone you're teaching has zero knowledge but infinite intelligence.
* Remember people's professional and code backgrounds (QA, DBA, C++, Java, JS) and relate where possible.

# OUR IDEAS (Technically Capable 2)
### Encourage collaboration and interaction
* Explicitly say that student should try to answer each other's questions, that it's a really great way to reinforce learning and builds community. 
* If a question is asked, ask if anyone in the class thinks they can explain.
* Be especially encouraging of the first few questions, to try to get things rolling. 
  * You could say things like "I'm glad you asked!" or "I actually wondered that, too." or "Great question!"
* Hand someone the whiteboard marker if it exists. 

### Don't talk down or be negative
* Students have diverse backgrounds
* If they aren't getting a concept, avoid anything that might shame them.
* Don't be surprised when someone hasn't heard of something before.
* Don't grab anyone's keyboard. Avoid taking over unless you think it's *really* necessary. Ask before you do. "Mind if I drive for a sec?"

# OUR IDEAS (Technically Capable 3)
### Don't go too deep for your class level, but also, don't gloss over things
* Basically: walk the middle path
* When you're trying to be accurate, it's easy to go down a rabbit hole of specificity. Avoid. 
* Talk to your TAs about avoiding that, and how you can hold each other accountable.
* Explain the big picture of a command *before* they type it in. 
  * So before typing the command to deploy to Heroku, explain the difference between localhost and Heroku.

# DISCUSSION (DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?)
## How can you help people feel like you know what's going on?

# OUR IDEAS (KNOW WHAT'S UP 1)
### Introduce yourself well
* Tell your story.
* Talk about why you like programming and teaching.
* Talk about why you care enough to do this.
* Don't brag.

### Know what's going on
* Cover logistics at the beginning of class
  * Planned breaks, lunch time
  * Remind students that there is a closing presentation at the end
  * Tell them where the bathroom is
  * Tell them where the afterparty is	 

# OUR IDEAS (KNOW WHAT'S UP 2)
### Establish ground rules
* Questions are always welcome, even if the student thinks it might be dumb
* Explain that if someone has trouble not getting the expected output, the TAs will help troubleshoot
* If anyone wants to switch classes, tell them they should feel TOTALLY COMFORTABLE switching at any point.

### Don't be afraid to:
* Call on people! 
* Correct people (gently and politely) if they're wrong.
* Answer questions that haven't been asked yet. 

# OUR IDEAS (KNOW WHAT'S UP 3)
### Try to have good pacing
* Don't go too fast. You will probably go too fast. Check in occasionally to ensure everyone is still with you. 
* You can say the same thing THREE TIMES and it will not be boring yet. 
* When you ask a question, wait TEN WHOLE SECONDS before saying anything else. People need time to think. 
* Don't let the most advanced students dictate the pacing

# DISCUSSION
Talk about what problems you might anticipate, and what to do about the. 

# OUR IDEAS
### Some issues:
* Student in the wrong class level
* Student is disruptive
* Student is disengaged
* TA is not helping

# DISCUSSION
TAs: What are they good for? Absolutely everything!!!

# OUR IDEAS
* Ask your TA to explain a concept--they may be more technically advanced than the Teacher. 
* TAs can help people who get lost
* Encourage your TAs to jump in to help explain something if you're struggling
* TAs can ask the first question to encourage students to speak up. 

# DISCUSSION
How can you tell if they understand the words you're saying?

# OUR IDEAS
* Don't ask yes/no questions ... they are too easy.
* Pay attention to body language
* Ask "How would you do \{this\}?" or "If I wanted to do \{that}, what would I do?"

### Calling on people
* Don't be a jerk
* Call on people to make the class more interactive and engaging, rather than a lecture. 
* ???
