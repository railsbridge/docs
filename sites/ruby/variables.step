Try making variables with the following kinds of names names in irb:

* all letters (like 'folders')

* all numbers (like '2000')

* an underscore (like 'first_name')

* a dash (like 'last-name')

* a number anywhere (like 'y2k')

* a number at the start (like '101dalmations')

* a number at the end (like 'starwars2')
