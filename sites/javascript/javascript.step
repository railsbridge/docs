### Goal

This curriculum is meant to introduce the javascript programming language. It builds on the [Front End RailsBridge Curriculum](http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/frontend). Anyone familiar with HTML, will be able to work through this curriculum.

In the workshop, we will:

* Learn about and use the primitive types of javascript, 
* Learn about and use functions and callbacks,
* Understand scope, and the changing value of the keyword 'this'
* Use javascript to create a simple single page application.
* Use git to version control our application.

This is just a rough guideline, not a mandate. Some steps you'll go over and some you'll go under. It'll all work out by the end of the day. :D

### Requirements

We're going to be working with:

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
  (If you're experienced with the developer tools in another browser, that may work too.)
* The code editor of your choice.
  [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is popular and free to download, but you should buy a license if you keep using it after the workshop.
  [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit) is a good open source option, if you don't have one yet.

Optional tools if you're checking in to GitHub: 

* Git
* Your [GitHub](http://github.com) account

### Working Effectively and Efficiently

We highly recommend you do the following:

* Open your browser fresh or hide any windows you already have open.
  * Bring up one window with two tabs
    * One for this content
    * One for interacting with your app.
* Open your text editor and _do not ever close it_. We're not quitters.
* Hide all extra applications. Turn off twitter, IM, and all other distractions.

By minimizing the number of things you interact with, you reduce the
amount of time spent switching between them and the context lost as
you work through the lessons. Having 50 tabs open in your web
browser gets confusing and wastes time.
