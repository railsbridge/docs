#Clone a Repo Contining HTML & CSS

To review these concepts we will be using Javascript to manipulate a deck of cards that will later be used to make a game.
The HTML and CSS files have been provided for you and can be copied to your local computer by cloning a repository from the Railsbridge GitHub account.
If you have a [graphical user interface client for git](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) that you like and know how to use you can use that; 
otherwise you can use the console. If the wifi is out, or you have other problems, the instructor can probaby supply the files 
on a USB stick for you to copy.  Remember to ask a TA if you get stuck or need help.

##Install Git
If you have git installed already, great! If not, you can follow the instructions for installing git from the 
[Railsbridge Installfest](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest) for Rails, then return to this page.


##Configure Git
Follow the [instructions for configuring git](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/configure_git) from the 
Railsbridge Rails workshop and then return to this page.

##Clone the Repo / Copy the Files

Create a directory that you want to save your Railsbridge files in (if you haven't done so before). If you're using the console type:
$`mkdir railsbridge`
then, to change to that directory
$`cd railsbridge` .

+ To clone the repo from the Railsbridge repository type:
$`git clone http://whatever-i'll-look-this-up-later`  _note: I don't think these files are in the repo yet, 
so the correct URL can't be inserted yet_ - this 
will save the files from Github to your computer.
+ If you have issues installing git:  to download the files as a `.zip` archive, navigate in your browser 
to the page containing them on the GitHub site, and click on _Download ZIP_ button and save to your `railsbridge` directory.
+ If you are getting the files from a USB drive, transfer them to your `railsbridge` directory. 

If you got the files as a `.zip` archive, extract them to a directory using your usual methods.  
Look at a file listing in your directory to verify the files are there.

Now you should be ready to start writing javascript to manipulate the elements on the HTML page (the next step).

##more info on git (extra stuff you can read later if you want)
[Git](http://git-scm.com) is not just used for transferring files, it's one of a variety of 
[version control systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_revision_control_software) that let 
you backup your files and share them with others in group development.  Railsbridge has its files on [GitHub](http://github.com),
a [public Git hosting site](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitHosting).

There are videos and written documentation on using git at [http://git-scm.com/documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation). 
For more information from Railsbridge on using git see:  [Railsbridge Guide on How to Git](http://railsbridge.github.io/bridge_troll/).
