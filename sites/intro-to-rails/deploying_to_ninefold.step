        Of course read the blurb about how Ninefold accesses your GitHub.

        We will ask you to grant us some permissions. (Ninefold will never make changes to your codebase or read your followers or your gists. These were just set by GitHub by default. We just require this so we can redeploy your app for you automagically.)
