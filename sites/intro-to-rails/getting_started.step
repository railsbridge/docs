Open the suggestotron folder as a project in your text editor.

In **Sublime Text 2**, you can use the `Project > Add Folder to Project...` menu option:

<img src='img/sublime_add_folder_to_project.png' />

Select your `suggestotron` folder from the file picker that opens. If everything works out Sublime should look something like this:

<img src='img/sublime_project_as_folder.png' />
