  message <<-MARKDOWN
  * `pluralize(topic.votes.count, "vote")` displays the number of votes the topic has, plus the word 'vote' or 'votes' accordingly.
  * `button_to '+1'` creates an html button with the value '+1'.
  * `votes_path(topic_id: topic.id)` creates the right url for the action we want to invoke. In this case, we want to create a vote for the current topic.
    * `votes_path(topic_id: 42)` would output `/votes?topic_id=42`
  * `method: :post` ensures we do the create action of CRUD, not the read action.

  The changes we made to votes controller are a bit more complicated so let's work through them line by line.

  * `topic = Topic.find(params[:topic_id])`
    * Finds the topic in the database with that id and stores it in the variable 'topic'.
    * `params[:topic_id]` corresponds to the topic_id part of the votes_path above (eg `?topic_id=42`).
  * `vote = topic.votes.build` creates a new vote for the current topic.
  * `vote.save!` saves the vote to the database.
  * `redirect_to(topics_path)` tells the browser to go back to topics_path (the topics list).
