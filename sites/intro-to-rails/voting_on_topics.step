  * Just like before, we're creating a new model named "vote"
  * The only thing really different is the integer we added called `topic_id`.
    * `topic_id` is the data we need to draw the line between votes and topics.
  * We didn't generate a full scaffold this time because we aren't
    going to do the full CRUD for votes; they're just going to be
    considered part of topics as-is.
