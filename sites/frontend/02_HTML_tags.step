## Use Tags to Separate Blocks of Content

You'll notice that even if you put in extra lines and spaces, HTML will treat any number of
new line or space characters like there's just one space there. When you're getting started
with HTML, this can seem like a pain, because you have to type 

MARKDOWN
source_code "HTML", "<p>first sentence</p>\n<p>second sentence</p>"
message <<-MARKDOWN

when all you want is a blank line between two sentences. But as you get more advanced, this
aspect of HTML will feel more useful, because it means you can format your code however is
most readable for **you**, without worrying about what the browser will think of your blank
lines and spaces.

### Nested Tags

It's common for an HTML tag to be nested inside another tag. In the example above, you saw:

MARKDOWN
source_code "HTML", "<h1><em></em></h1>"

important "Just make sure that the tags are correctly _nested_. For example, you can't do:"

source_code "HTML", "<h1><em>Hello World!</h1> I like you!</em>"
message <<-MARKDOWN

The inner tag, `em`, needs to close before the outer tag closes.

## Tags for Every Occasion

The meteoric rise in popularity of the world-wide-web and the recent proliferation of web
applications has made HTML hugely popular.  While originally used only for simple documents,
HTML now has tags for embedded video and music playback, embedding images, filling out
web forms, and all kinds of other useful tags.

You just used two well-known tags, `h1` for a headline and `p` for a paragraph. But there
are a ton of other tags you might use:

MARKDOWN


table :border=>"1", :cellspacing=>"0", :cellpadding=>"3", :align=>"center" do
  tr {
    th " Tag"
    th " Purpose"
  }
  tr {
    td " a"
    td " A link (the 'a' stands for Anchor)"
  }
  tr {
    td " ul"
    td " Start a bulleted list (an 'unordered list')"
  }
  tr {
    td " ol"
    td " Start a numbered list (an 'ordered list')"
  }
  tr {
    td " li"
    td " Add a list item to a bulleted or numbered list"
  }
  tr {
    td " audio"
    td " Link to an audio file (allows users to play the file in the page)"
  }
  tr {
    td " table, tr, td"
    td " Data tables with table rows and data cells"
  }
  tr {
    td " form"
   td " A form that can collect data from user input"
  }
  tr {
    td " input"
    td " A text input, a button, or a checkbox in a form"
  }
end

Don't try to memorize all the tags! You can always look them up on sites like:
