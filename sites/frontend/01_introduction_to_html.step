## What is HTML?

HTML stands for __H__yper-__t__ext __M__arkup __L__anguage.

Now that you've used some HTML, let's go through each of those words in reverse order and explain them...

* __L__anguange - People use different languages for different types of communication.
  We use languages such as English or Mandarin for human communication or languages such as
  Ruby or Java to give instructions to computers.  HTML is a special language for describing documents.

* __M__arkup - Being a *markup* language means that HTML is mixed in with plain content text. 
  Think of a time when you turned in an essay to your teacher.  Your teacher reads your essay
  and *marks* it *up* with comments or suggestions, adding extra information on top of the plain text
  content.

- __H__yper-__t__ext - This term comes from the fact that early computers could only work with plain text
  files.  Computer users as early as the 1960s wanted to enrich this text and make it easier to work with.
  Thus, hypertext was born.  It is text because the file is stored as plain text, yet hyper because the text
  has a special meaning beyond the plain text when interpreted by a special program.  For HTML, that special
  program is your web browser.


## That First Example ##

As always, we started with a simple hello world. We were able to get a message to 
render in the browser with _just_ plain text:

---

Hello World!

---

But that did't show us how *hyper*text works.

## HTML is Tags ##

In order to add special meaning to text, we need give the browser clues about how the
text should look but we have to do so in a way that makes it easy for both browsers
and people to tell the difference between content and hypertext.  HTML does this
with "tags".  An HTML tag is encased within `<`, `>`, called "angle brackets".  An
example tag is `<html>`.  Every tag has an accompanying closing tag.  Closing tags are
also encased in angle brackets but begin with a forward slash. So the closing tag that
matches our example would be `</html>`. A tag and its content create an HTML _element_.

You just coded your own matched pair of an opening and closing html tag:

MARKDOWN

source_code "HTML", "Hello <em>World</em>!"

message <<-MARKDOWN
Remember that `em` was short for <em>em</em>phasis.  It's a tag that means we want the text to stand out in front of the user. The browser's standard way of displaying emphasis is to italicize the text, like so:

---

Hello <em>World</em>!

---

Of course, with CSS, we can tell the browser to change the way it displays emphasis. We'll come back to this later.
