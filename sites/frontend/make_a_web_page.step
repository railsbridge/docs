## Inline vs. Linked 

Javascript and CSS can both be put directly into the HTML page, but on bigger projects,
you'll usually want to place your js and CSS in separate files and include those files
in your HTML with a link.

Linking files will help you keep your code organized and easier to maintain. It means,
for example, that if you change the style of buttons on your website, you'll be able to
change it in just one place, instead of having to update every page.

### Javascript

* A JavaScript tag looks like this when it's wrapping code written right into the HTML page:

  MARKDOWN
  source_code "HTML", "<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\s\s// Your code goes here! \n</script>"
  message <<-MARKDOWN

* A JavaScript tag looks like this when it's a link:

  MARKDOWN
  source_code "HTML", "<script src=\"resources/javascript.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>"
  message <<-MARKDOWN

### CSS

* A CSS stylesheet looks like this when it's written right into the HTML page:

  MARKDOWN
  source_code "HTML", "<style type=\"text/css\" media=\"all\">\n\s\s/* Your styles go here! */ \n</style>"
  message <<-MARKDOWN

* A CSS tag looks like this when it's a link:

  MARKDOWN
  source_code "HTML", "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"resources/layout.css\" type=\"text/css\">"
