## What Are These Files?

Just to save you some time, we've supplied a bare bones HTML document, a CSS stylesheet,
a JavaScript file, and a placeholder image. But you could have typed up these files yourself
with your text editor, if you'd wanted to.

If you are starting a new project in the future, try typing it all out by hand a few times
to get the hang of it, and then try starting with some other people's HTML boilerplate code
that they've shared:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), a blank template with lots of tips for high-performance best practices.
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), an HTML / CSS base with a big library of styles to test out.
