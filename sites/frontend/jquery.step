## What We Did With jQuery

We just used jQuery to handle a click event and follow instructions to change that
element's style when it's clicked. We wrapped all of that code in a
`$(document).ready(function(){ ... });` call to make sure it only runs when the
browser has read our document and is ready to act on it.

When you work with your HTML document in jQuery, you're actually doing something called
**DOM manipulation.** The DOM is the Document Object Model &mdash; it's a representation of your
HTML that lives in the JavaScript layer. When people say that JavaScript is hard, they frequently
mean that _DOM manipulation_ is hard &mdash; you're forced to think about your document with
three totally different models in mind all at once (one for HTML, one for CSS, one for JavaScript).
jQuery gives developers an easier, more succinct interface for working with the DOM than
native JavaScript does.


## Why jQuery

jQuery is a library of code written in JavaScript. Anything you can do with jQuery, you could
also write in straight JavaScript without jQuery, but there are some advantages:

* jQuery allows you to write code that will run in lots of browsers without modification. Although
  this is improving as years go by, there are currently differences between how you'd write JavaScript
  for one popular browser (like Chrome) versus another (like Internet Explorer 8). jQuery lets you
  write your functions one way, and then when your code is loaded in the user's browser, jQuery
  does the work of translating it into the right format for the browser it's currently running in.

* jQuery allows you to select elements using the same syntax as CSS. Since many web developers are
  great at selecting elements with CSS, you can carry this same knowledge over to JavaScript.

* jQuery is designed to make life easier for web developers, so it has lots of shorthand functions
  for doing common things like animations and showing and hiding elements.

jQuery is not the only choice for a JavaScript framework, it's just a very popular one.
You can also check out other libraries like Dojo, Zepto, or YUI.
