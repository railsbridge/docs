But if you're partial to another browser, there's usually a similar set of tools you can use, either built in (Internet Explorer 9, Safari) or installable with plugins (FireFox)."

## Keep Learning with Dev Tools

With good browser dev tools, you can pick apart every website you visit. If you see cool
CSS styles or JavaScript animations, you can always look under the hood and figure out how
they're done. It's a great way to keep learning as a front end developer.
