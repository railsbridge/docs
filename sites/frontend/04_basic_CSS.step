## What is CSS?

CSS stands for __C__ascading __S__tyle__s__heets. It's a language for creating **rules** that
can **select** various elements on the page and change their **visual properties**.

* __C__ascading - The 'cascade' is one of the trickier elements of CSS to master, but it
  basically means you can define a bunch of styling rules of different strengths, and CSS
  will apply them all, resolving any conflicting rules by allowing stronger rules overwrite
  (or _cascade_ over) weaker rules.

* __S__tyle__s__sheets - CSS files are called 'stylesheets' because they allow you to put your
  styling rules into a separate document (a 'sheet') of file type .css, and then choose to
  include one or more in a given HTML page. This is a powerful feature for sites with many pages,
  since it means you can write your rules once and then include them everywhere on your site with
  a single link on each page.

## CSS Rules Are Made of a Selector and Attributes

* The **Selector** tells the browser what elements to add that style to.
* The **Attributes** (or **Properties**) tell the browser how to style the elements you selected.

Don't try to memorize all the CSS properties! You can always look them up on sites like:

## You Can Get Crazy with CSS

Most of the fancy effects you'll see on the web are done with CSS. For example, here's two
pictures of the same HTML page, but on the right side, I've turned off all the CSS that was
applied to it. Almost all of the color and formatting disappear. The code snippets and buttons
that were obvious with CSS styles now just look like text.

For some great examples of the power of CSS, check out the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/). It takes
the same HTML, but shows it with stylesheets from a bunch of different designers applied to
it. Here are two different designers' interpretations of the same HTML:
