Not only is this more typing, and harder to read, it's also easily breakable. (You can only set an element's onclick attribute to one thing, so it might get overwritten by another script on the page and not work later!) jQuery works in a different way, by listening for events, so different functions can all be listening for the same event, and you can add a new response to an event without worrying about overwriting an existing one."

## So Should I Use JavaScript or jQuery?

Don't forget that everything you can do with jQuery, you can do with straight JavaScript.
If you want to start building cool user interface features right away, jQuery will probably
help you do that the fastest. But, long-term, to be great at jQuery, you really need to
understand the language it's written in: JavaScript. It's worthwhile to learn about both.
