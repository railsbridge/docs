## What Are These Files?

Just to save you some time, we've supplied a bare bones HTML document, a CSS stylesheet,
a JavaScript file, and a placeholder image. But you could have typed up these files yourself
with your text editor, if you'd wanted to.

If you are starting a new project in the future, try typing it all out by hand a few times
to get the hang of it, and then try starting with some other people's HTML boilerplate code
that they've shared:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), a blank template with lots of tips for high-performance best practices.
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), an HTML / CSS base with a big library of styles to test out.

## Why Did We Go to the Github Site?

The step where we downloaded the files from Github and put them in our project didn't
have to involve opening up the browser, downloading a zip file, and dragging and dropping
files &mdash; it all could have been done from the command line with git.

As you memorize git commands and get comfortable on the command line, you'll find
it's frequently faster to do these tasks from there, but we wanted to take this chance
to introduce you to the Github web interface. It's powerful enough to let you download
whole projects, fork repositories, and even make basic edits to files, right from
the browser.
