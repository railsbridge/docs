## Use Tags to Separate Blocks of Content

message <<-MARKDOWN

  Tags convey meaning. And in order to display your content well, everything should be inside of a tag, not just words you want emphasized. So let's use the paragraph tag `<p>` and the header 1 tag `<h1>`.

  You'll notice that even if you put in extra lines and spaces, HTML will treat any number of
  new line or space characters like there's just one space there. When you're getting started
  with HTML, this can seem like a pain, because you have to type
MARKDOWN

source_code "HTML", "<p>first sentence</p>\n<p>second sentence</p>"

message <<-MARKDOWN

  when all you want is a blank line between two sentences. But as you get more advanced, this
  aspect of HTML will feel more useful, because it means you can format your code however is
  most readable for **you**, without worrying about what the browser will think of your blank
  lines and spaces.

## Nested Tags


  It's common for an HTML tag to be nested inside another tag. In the example above, you saw:
MARKDOWN

source_code "HTML", "<h1><em></em></h1>"

important do
  message "Just make sure that the tags are correctly _nested_. For example, you can't do:"

  source_code "HTML", "<h1><em>Hello World!</h1> I like you!</em>"

  message "The inner tag, `em`, needs to close before the outer tag closes."
end




end

steps do

  step do
    message "Add some more lines of content to your HTML file. Introduce yourself."
    source_code "HTML", "Hello <em>World</em>!\n\nMy name is Rachel."
    message "Now save the file and refresh your browser."
    message "<img src='img/hello_world_2line.png'>"
  end

  step do
    message "Even though we put in some blank lines, the browser ignored them. So we'll have to use tags to break up our content."
    message "Update your HTML with an `h1` tag and a `p` tag:"
    source_code "HTML", "<h1>Hello <em>World</em>!</h1>\n\n<p>My name is Rachel.</p>"
    message "Now save the file and refresh your browser."
    message "<img src='img/hello_world_2line2.png'>"
  end

  step do
    message "Now let's add a list of things we like."
    source_code "HTML", "<h1>Hello <em>World</em>!</h1>\n<p>My name is Rachel.</p>\n<p>I like:</p>\n<ul>\n\s\s<li>Polka Dots</li>\n\s\s<li>Soccer</li>\n\s\s<li>Programming</li>\n</ul>"
    message "Now save the file and refresh your browser."
    message "<img src='img/html_tags_list.png'>"
  end

end

## Tags for Every Occasion

The meteoric rise in popularity of the world-wide-web and the recent proliferation of web
applications has made HTML hugely popular.  While originally used only for simple documents,
HTML now has tags for embedded video and music playback, embedding images, filling out
web forms, and all kinds of other useful tags.

You just used two well-known tags, `h1` for a headline and `p` for a paragraph. But there
are a ton of other tags you might use:

    td "A text input, a button, or a checkbox in a form"
  }
  tr {
    td "div"
    td "A section marker that doesn't do anything specific to the contents itself, but does make a new line after. (More on this later.)"
  }
  tr {
    td "span"
    td "Another section marker that doesn't do anything to its contents, but is inline - it does not make a new line after."
  }

Don't try to memorize all the tags! You can always look them up on sites like:

* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element)
* [Dochub](http://dochub.io/#html/)

## Try This
What happens if you change the `<ul>` to `<ol>`? (Don't forget to change the closing tag, too.)

Can you link your favorite things to their respective Wikipedia pages? Here's an example link for you: `<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a>`
