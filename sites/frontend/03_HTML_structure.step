## The HTML tag and Doctype Clarify the Obvious

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser which flavor of HTML you're using. You may see 
older doctypes out there that are longer and a lot more complicated, from when people
used various HTML and XHTML versions, but if you create a new page, you can usually just
use this short version. It tells your browser you're using the latest version of HTML,
HTML 5, and it's easy to type.

The `<html>` tag tells your browser something it could probably guess, that your page is
HTML, but it's polite to add it anyway. It wraps all the content of the page (except the
`doctype`) and states unequivocally, "Here is my HTML!!!"

## Pages, Like People, Have a Head and a Body

source_code "HTML", "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n\s\s<head></head>\n\s\s<body>Content...</body>\n</html>"

### The Head

The Head doesn't contain information that you want to see printed on the page. It contains
info _about_ the document, including what language or character set you're using, what
the page title should be, and what CSS and JavaScript files to include when the page is
loaded. It might even contain metadata tags that can tell a search engine or another
program more about the file, like who wrote it or what keywords are relevant.

### The Body

The Body contains the actual content of your file, the things you'll actually want your users
to be able to see, read, or interact with at some point.
