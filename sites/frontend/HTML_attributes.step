## Why Attributes?

HTML tags don't just wrap content. They can also convey information about that element, with attributes. For example, on the last page you coded a `style` tag with a `media` attribute that you set equal to `screen`, which told the browser, 'Use these styles when you're displaying content on screen, but not when you're printing it on the laser printer:'

  MARKDOWN
  source_code "HTML", "<style type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\">"
  message <<-MARKDOWN

Sometimes, attributes will have an obvious visual effect. For example, if you're coding
form inputs, you'll use attributes to tell the browser what type of input they are,
and the results will be easy to tell apart. This input: 

  MARKDOWN
  source_code "HTML", "<input type='radio' name='rando-radio'>"
  message <<-MARKDOWN

looks like a radio button: <input type='radio' name='rando-radio'>, but 

  MARKDOWN
  source_code "HTML", "<input type='password' name='fake-password' value='ick'>"
  message <<-MARKDOWN
looks like a password text input: <input type='password' name='rando-radio' value='ick'> even though they use the same tag.

## Classes vs. IDs

* A **class** attribute should be used to group elements that _could_ exist
  more than once on a given page. For example, you might give certain
  paragraphs a class of "special" and use that class to highlight them.
  Even if you only have one paragraph that's special now, you might
  want to add more later.
  
* An **id** is a unique label. Use it to identify things you'd only have one
  of. For example, if you ran a news website, you would only have one element
  on a page that would serve as a masthead, and you could give it an id
  like `id="handsome-header"`
