* You should have a new rails app with with a static home page that's under your control. Make sure the controller for this page is called **HomeController**.

discussion do
message <<-MARKDOWN
* In order to have a static home page, you will need a route, a controller, a view. Discuss!
  * Seriously. If you don't discuss this stuff, things will be SO much harder.
* Generators! Rails has lots of them. Try exploring the output of `rails generate`.
* We’re not using `rails generate scaffold` in this curriculum. Because you will generate all your Models, Views and Controllers yourself, this will force you, to do more understanding-building brain work. The teacher/TAs can perhaps comment on what they would do in the real world and their thoughts on the excellence of this choice for learning-purposes.
* What do you need to add to your home controller (after you've made it) to have a static home page?  
* How does the home/index.html.erb view file relate to the layouts/application.html.erb view file?
* What’s the significance of yield in the application view?
* What does the home controller do?
