discussion do
message <<-MARKDOWN
* Chrome developer tools / Firefox Firebug plugin — how to use ’em!
* What’s Bootstrap and (optional) why is everyone totally in love with it (or at least using it all over the place)?
* Maybe review the home/index.html.erb view file as it relates to the layouts/application.html.erb view file again, and where you might want to make some edits to take advantage of Bootstrap.
* Someone should explain how erb works — you'll be using it to show the user email address in right side
