RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager and is the easiest way to install and manage Ruby.  The [official RVM install instructions](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) are available here, but this should work for you:
MARKDOWN

step "Install RVM" do
  console "curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable"
  message "This will do some stuff and print a long message which you can ignore."
end

step "Configure your shell" do

  message "Every time you open a new terminal window, rvm will be active inside it. Close your terminal window and open a new one."

  verify do
    console "type rvm | head -1"
    result "rvm is a function"

    console "rvm -v"
    fuzzy_result "rvm 1{FUZZY}.x.x (stable) by Wayne E. Seguin (wayneeseguin@gmail.com), Michal Papis <mpapis@gmail.com> [https://rvm.io/]{/FUZZY}"
  end

end
