**Challenge:** The **index.html** page you downloaded is a simple profile page. Do a quick read through of the HTML and see if you can guess from the context what any unfamiliar tags might do.

Take 5 or 10 minutes to replace some of the existing text with some info about yourself. You don't have to write a novella, but filling in some tags is a good way to get oriented in the file. Then, save the page and refresh the browser.

**Challenge:** Add an image tag to the page, right above the word 'Contents'. There's a sample image in the resources folder that you can use called 'picture.jpg', but if you want to personalize your page, copy a picture of yourself into the resources folder and add that to the page instead.

**Hints**: images are usually included with an `img` tag; the tag's `src` attribute provides the path to the file.

When you're done, you'll have something like this:

<img src='img/page_img.png'>

Don't forget that, because it doesn't wrap text content, the `img` tag is self-closing, meaning it doesn't need an ending tag. You don't need to write `</img>`.

**Challenge:** Add two kinds of anchor links.

Links in html are created by the `a` tag. Add an `a` tag somewhere in the document that creates a link to another page on the web.

If you're not sure what attributes an `a` tag can have, see if you can look it up on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element/a).

You can also make links that stay on the current page and just point to another block of content. Instead of linking to a url, they'll link to the id of an element you want to jump to, with an attribute like `href='#id-name'`

See if you can turn the list items under the word 'Contents' into links that jump down the page to the relevant content. They'll look like this:

<img src='img/page_anchors.png'>
    MARKDOWN

Now that you know the basics of working with HTML, the trickiest part is remembering what tags are available. Here are some good sites you can use for reference:

* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Element);
* [HTML5 Doctor's Element Index](http://html5doctor.com/element-index/).
