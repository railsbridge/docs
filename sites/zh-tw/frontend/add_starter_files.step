      The zip file should contain a file called index.html and a directory of resources.

      <img src='img/zip.png'>

      Drag the file called index.html and resources folder into your project folder. Go ahead and replace the index.html file you may already have in there.

## What Are These Files?

Just to save you some time, we've supplied a bare bones HTML document, a CSS stylesheet,
a JavaScript file, and a placeholder image.

If you are starting a new project in the future, try typing it all out by hand a few times
to get the hang of it, and then try starting with some other people's HTML boilerplate code
that they've shared:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), a blank template with lots of tips for high-performance best practices.
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), an HTML / CSS / JS base with a big library of styles to test out.
* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), another HTML / CSS / JS framework you can test out.
