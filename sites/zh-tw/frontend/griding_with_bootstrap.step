## Final thoughts!

The grid is one of Bootstrap's most powerful features. In fact, many developers who generally build their own components often still use the grid from Bootstrap (or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)) simply because it saves time in development by making it easier to build sites that work on all screen sizes.
