## The HTML tag and DOCTYPE

`<!DOCTYPE html>` is called the doctype, and it tells the browser which flavor of HTML you're using. `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells your browser you're using HTML5, the latest version of HTML.

(You may see older doctypes out there that are longer and a lot more complicated, from when people
used various HTML and XHTML versions. You can usually just
use this short version for new websites.)

The `<html>` encloses all the rest of your page and states "Here is my HTML!"

## Pages, Like People, Have a Head and a Body

  MARKDOWN
  source_code :html, <<HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>

  <head>
    <!-- Important invisible details will go here! -->

</html>

### The Head

The `head` contains information that is not displayed in your browser. It has metadata (data about data) tags that can tell a search engine or another program more about the file, like who wrote it or what keywords are relevant, such as:

 * What language or character set you're using: `<meta charset="utf-8">`
 * What the page title should be: `<title>HTML!</title>`
 * What CSS and JavaScript files to include (and where they are): `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`

  MARKDOWN
  source_code :html, <<HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HTML!</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Meta">
    <meta name="description" content="Learning HTML, CSS, & JS one step at a time.">
  </head>
</html>
HTML

### The Body

The body contains the actual content of your file, the things you'll want your users
to be able to see, read, or interact with!

    message <<-MARKDOWN
Let's add the doctype, HTML, head, and body tags to your hello.html file. It should look something like this:

<img src='img/hello_structure.png'>

Save the file and refresh your browser. Everything should look mostly the same.

    MARKDOWN

  step do
    message "Let's add a title to our page within the `<head>` section. Add this line:"
    source_code :html, "<title>My Sample HTML page</title>"
    message <<-MARKDOWN
When you refresh your browser, you should see the title on the tab in Chrome.

<img src='img/hello_title.png'>

(If it doesn't show up, double check that you put the line between the opening and closing head tags, and that you saved your file before refreshing.)
