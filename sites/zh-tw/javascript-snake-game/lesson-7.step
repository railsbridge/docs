# Lesson 7 - Changing the Snakes Movement Direction

markdown <<-MARKDOWN
  To change the direction of the snake, we need to change the direction of
  its first segment. Add the following function to snake.js:

  ```js
  var changeDirection = function(direction) {
    snake[0].direction = direction;
  }
  ```

  Next, we have CHUNK call changeDirection when an arrow key is pressed.
  Add the following line at the end of snake.js:

  ```js
  CHUNK.onArrowKey(changeDirection);
  ```

  This tells CHUNK to call the `changeDirection` function every time an arrow key
  is pressed.

  Just like we pass our snake object into the `drawSnake` function, we can pass
  the `changeDirection` function into the `onArrowKey` function.

  In JavaScript, we can pass functions into functions just like we can pass
  arrays, strings, integers, and objects into functions
