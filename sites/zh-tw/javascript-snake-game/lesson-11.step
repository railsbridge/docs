# Lesson 11 - Making an Apple Appear on the Screen

markdown <<-MARKDOWN
  Let's make it so an apple appears on the screen!

  ```js
  var draw = function(snakeToDraw, apple) {
    var drawableSnake = { color: "green", pixels: snakeToDraw };
    var drawableApple = { color: "red", pixels: [apple] };
    var drawableObjects = [drawableSnake, drawableApple];
    CHUNK.draw(drawableObjects);
  }
  ```

  We renamed the `drawSnake` function and let it take multiple arguments so it
  can draw an apple.

  Next, let's make sure we pass the `apple` to the `draw` function, when we call it!

  ```js
  var advanceGame = function() {
    snake = moveSnake(snake);
    if (CHUNK.detectCollisionBetween(snake, CHUNK.gameBoundaries())) {
      CHUNK.endGame();
      CHUNK.flashMessage("Whoops! you hit a wall!");
    }
    draw(snake, apple);
  }
  ```

  Finally, let's create an apple to be drawn!

  ```js
  var apple = { top: 8, left: 10 };
  ```

  * Why do you think we put `[]` around the apple in the `draw` function?
