    JavaScript is a fully featured programming language with variables, loops,
    and conditionals. Just like Ruby, Java, Python, and PHP, you can use JavaScript
    to do math, model large systems, and perform complex calculations – all in your browser!
    In this lesson, we'll learn about the fundamentals of the JavaScript programming language.

  step "Launch your programming environment" do
    message <<-MARKDOWN

      When programming, you'll generally want these tools on hand:

      * Your browser to see the code running (I recommend Chrome)
      * A text editor to change the code (I recommend <a
      href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a>)
      * A javascript console so you can experiment and print out debugging
      messages. This is built into your browser.

      Some helpful links for browser consoles:

      * <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools">How to launch dev tools in chrome.</a>
      * <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/bg182326.aspx">How to launch dev tools in internet explorer.</a>
      * <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Console">How to launch dev tools in firefox.</a>
      * <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.html">How to launch dev tools in safari.</a>

      Once you have these tools available, we need to open the files we'll be working with:

      * Open game/snake.js in your text editor
      * Open game/index.html in your browser


      Now open up your browser's developer tools, and click over to the console tab. Type the following code:
    MARKDOWN

    source_code :javascript, <<-JAVASCRIPT
      console.log('programming!');
    JAVASCRIPT

    message <<-MARKDOWN
      Press enter. Your browser should now look like this:
      <img src="img/browser_console.png" alt="image of browser console with console.log"></img>

      Congrats, you just wrote your first lines of JavaScript code! __console.log__ is an important function –
      it allows you to print information to the browser's console. It's very helpful in debugging! You can also
      use the __alert__ function to make a message pop up in the browser. Try it out!

    message <<-MARKDOWN
      Here we're using the variable `fruits` to hold a collection of fruit names.
      An array, designated by the `[ ]` (square-brackets), is a list of data that can be referenced by its index.
      The index is the position inside the array, each separated by a comma. Arrays use 0-based indices, so the first element in an array is at Index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on.
      For example, in the array above, to get the string 'strawberry' in Javascript, you would type 'fruits[1]', which Javascript understands as: get the value at index 1 in the array fruits.

    message <<-MARKDOWN
Objects can also have __functions__, which can be helpful for altering objects and learning more about them.
Functions are __invoked__ with parentheses, which causes them to run.

      fruits.push("orange")

    JAVASCRIPT

    message <<-MARKDOWN
The __push__ function allows us to add new items to an array. the slice function returns a new array with
with everything to the right of the __index__ we provided. Here, we passed the function the number 1, so
slice returned an array with everything after the first element in the array. (Note that the first element is assigned 0 as its index rather than 1.)
