# Lesson 10 - Making the Tail Follow the Head

markdown <<-MARKDOWN
  To make the tail follow the head, we're going to assign the direction of the
  segment further forward in snake to the current segment when it moves. This way
  all segments follow the same path!

  Let's define a new function called `segmentFurtherDown` which takes a
  segment index and a snake and returns the segment closer to the head. Let's
  start with:

  ```js
  var segmentFurtherForwardThan = function(index, snake) {
    return snake[index - 1]
  }
  ```

  While this <em>seems</em> OK, in reality it has a nefarious bug! Open your console and type:

  ```js
  segmentFurtherForwardThan(1, snake);
  ```

  This returns a segment object, which looks great! But what happens if we try
  a index of 0?

  ```js
  segmentFurtherForwardThan(0, snake);
  ```

  Instead of a segment, we get `undefined`! This means we can't get a
  direction! Let's use an `if` statement to return the segment at the index if
  there isn't a segment further forward. Change `segmentFurtherForwardThan` to:


  ```js
  var segmentFurtherForwardThan = function(index, snake) {
    if (snake[index - 1] === undefined) {
      return snake[index];
    } else {
      return snake[index - 1];
    }
  }
  ```

  Now when you run `segmentFurtherForwardThan(0, snake)` it will return the
  snakes head instead of undefined. Excellent! Now we get to change moveSnake to
  use `segmentFurtherForwardThan` when it assigns the segments direction. Change `moveSnake` to:

  ```js
  var moveSnake = function(snake) {
    return snake.map(function(oldSegment, segmentIndex) {
      var newSegment = moveSegment(oldSegment);
      newSegment.direction = segmentFurtherForwardThan(segmentIndex, snake).direction;
      return newSegment;
    });
  }
  ```

  Great! Now each segment will follow the segment ahead of it!

  ### Syntax Breakdown

  `array.map` and `array.forEach` pass 3 arguments to the function it is given: the
  first is the element in the collection, the second is its index  (or location in the collection) and
  the third is the collection itself.
