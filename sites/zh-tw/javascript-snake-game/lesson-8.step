# Lesson 8 - Ending the Game When A Wall Is Hit

markdown <<-MARKDOWN
  Games aren't much fun if you can't lose them! Let's make it so when you hit
  a wall. CHUNK comes with a function to detect collisions between things, so
  we'll use that.
  
  Add an `if` statement to the `advanceGame` function like so:
  
  ```js
  var advanceGame = function() {
    snake = moveSnake(snake);
    if (CHUNK.detectCollisionBetween(snake, CHUNK.gameBoundaries())) {
      CHUNK.endGame();
      CHUNK.flashMessage("Whoops! you hit a wall!");
    }
    drawSnake(snake);
  }
  ```
  
  Now, when there is a collision between the snake and the border we can have
  CHUNK end the game and let the player know the game is over.

  ### Syntax Breakdown
  
  `CHUNK.detectCollisionBetween` takes two collections of coordinates and
  returns true if the collections share any pixels
  
  `CHUNK.endGame` tells chunk to stop calling the advanceGame function,
  effectively ending the game.
  
  `CHUNK.flashMessage` displays text to the user.
