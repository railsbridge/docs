* `generate scaffold` tells Rails to create everything necessary to get up and running with topics.
* `topic` tells Rails the name of the new model.
* `title:string` says that topics have a title, which is a "string".
* `description:text` says that topics have a description which is a "text". (What's the difference between "string" and "text"? Basically "text" is for strings that might be very long.)

  h2 "Rake"
  message <<-MARKDOWN
`rake` (**r**uby m**ake**) is a tool that allows you to run small Ruby programs (**tasks**) that you use often in your application.

Here, `rake db:migrate` is a task provided by the Rails framework. It uses the migration file we just created (`db/migrate/201xxxxxxxxxxx_create_topics.rb`) to change the database. Database migration files can be crucial to code collaboration.
