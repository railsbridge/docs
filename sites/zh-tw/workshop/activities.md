These activities are mostly taken from [Sharon Bowman](http://bowperson.com/)'s excellent books: [The Ten-Minute Trainer](http://www.amazon.com/Ten-Minute-Trainer-Teach-Quick-Stick/dp/0787974420/) and [Training From the Back of the Room](http://www.amazon.com/Training-Back-Room-Aside-Learn/dp/0787996629/). For each activity, **print out instructions and put them up on a wall**. These are ideas and options: don't try and do them all! :)

# <a name="warm-upexercises"></a> Warm-up exercises (a week before the workshop)

## <a name="whatyouknowandwhatsyourplan"></a> What you know, and whatâ€™s your plan

Send students an email, asking

* What are three things you already know about programming? (Small things or big things! Who does it? What can you make? Why do people write software?)
* What do you plan to do with what you learn?

# <a name="justbeforetheworkshopbegins"></a> Just before the workshop begins

## <a name="shareyouranswers"></a> Share your answers

* Grab a pen and sticky notes.
* Write down your answers to the warm-up questions.
* Swap your answers with someone else.
* Swap again with someone new.

# Put the sticky notes<br>up on the wall

## <a name="whatdoesadeveloperlooklike"></a> What does a developer look like?

* Grab a pen and sticky notes.
* Write down answers to: "What does a developer look like?"
* Take a card from the table and find out the answer.
* Compare your earlier answers to the person you found on the internet.

The cards are clues to finding developers (e.g. who wrote "Designing for Performance"). The answers are developers who are from groups of people that are underrepresented in tech.

## <a name="whatdoesanengineerlooklike"></a> What does an engineer look like?

* Grab a pen and sticky notes.

## <a name="findyourmatch"></a> Find Your Match

* Take an index card from the table.
* Find someone with the same card as you.
* Together, find out what the technical term means.
* One of the back of one of the cards, write the explanation down, and stick the cards up on the wall for other to read.

The cards have tech terms on them, such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, front-end, Ruby, Rails, Model, View, Controller, MVC. Alternate version: cards have just acronyms: HTML, CSS, JS, MVC, DB, SQL.

## <a name="matchitup"></a> Match It Up

* With a partner, grab a deck of index cards.
* Match up cards with their definitions.
* Check your answers.

The deck contains:

* Ruby
* Rails
* Git
* Heroku
* Sublime Text
* Terminal / Command Prompt
* Browser

These are in the opening presentation, and students have been using these things during the InstallFest. This activity helps them see how their learning is progressing.
