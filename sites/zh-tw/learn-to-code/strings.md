# String Messages

A string understands lots of messages. Here are a few:

    "banana".upcase
    "Cherry".downcase
    "titanic".capitalize
    "elderberry".reverse
    "fig".length
    "Fig Newton".swapcase
    "".empty?
    "syzygy".length

Try all of these out in irb!

# String Operators

A string knows DOT, but also understands several other operators:

    "blue" + "berry"
    "yum" * 10
    "elderberry"[8]

`+` `*` and `[]` are pronounced PLUS, TIMES, and SUB

Try these out in irb!

# Combining Messages and Operators

You can combine messages and operators at will.

    "fig".upcase.reverse
    "grape".reverse * 10 + "!!!"

Definitely try these out in irb! It's pretty fun.

# LAB: Playing With Strings

* What is the reverse of "stressed"?
* How many characters long is your name?
* What does your name look like, repeated 1000 times?
* What is the tenth character of "Matz is nice"? (Trick question!)
