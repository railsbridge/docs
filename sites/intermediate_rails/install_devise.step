* The user should be able to create an account and log in.
* The user should see a prompt to log in if they aren’t logged in.
* Once logged in, the user should see a static page with some kind of greeting.
* The page should display the logged-in user's email address and a link to log out.
* You, the developer, should explain to a teacher, TA, or fellow student how Rails knows to render the home view.

NB: This is all written assuming you run rails g controller home to create the home controller

discussion do
message <<-MARKDOWN
* What is devise?
* What files did devise add to your rails app?
* How will you add the log out link? What's the syntax for a DELETE action?

* Devise: authentication magic! Learn more about it here: https://github.com/plataformatec/devise
 * In the readme, scroll down to "Getting Started." You'll need to add it to your gem file. If you don't remember how, ask your neighbor! 
 * You probably don't want to just start typing commands from the devise readme. You probably want to read through that whole section first. (i.e., don't skip bundle!)

hints do
message <<-MARKDOWN
* Readme files are your best friends! Love them!
* The convention for naming models is to capitalize the first letter, like: User. 
* When you run rails generate devise:install, you get four instructions for things to configure. 2 & 3 are good to do. 
* The routes file goes through many common types of routes in the comments. This is also your friend.
* Devise has some magic that will help you with your logout link. Run rake routes and look for a route that helps you sign out. 
* Any time you generate a model in rails, you can use Rails Console to look at that model's methods and behavior interactively.
* You'll probably want to show the current user's email address only if they are presently signed in, right? Devise has a helper for you.
