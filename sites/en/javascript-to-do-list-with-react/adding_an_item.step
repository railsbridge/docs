JavaScript allows us to make our web page dynamic, and responsive to
the actions of our users. In this lesson, we'll allow our users to create
a new item for our list, and ask the server to save it to the database.

To do so, we're going to use JavaScript's ability to perform a task when a
user has taken an action on the page. JavaScript refers to these actions as
__events__. React makes it easy to listen to these events, and cause the page
to change when nevessary.

Our code will take the following steps.

1. When the user loads the page, our CreationForm component will start
  listening for when the user submits the form at the top of the page.

2. When a user submits the form (by pressing enter), we will prevent the page
  from refreshing, which is the normal behavior for a form.

3. The CreationForm component will then tell ListStore to add a new item.

4. ListStore will make an AJAX request to our server, creating an item with the
  description our user just provided.

5. Once the request succeeds, we will update the items variable with our new item.

6. Finally, we will tell the components to re-render themselves!

We've already written the first two steps for you. Let's finish the rest!

  step do
    message <<-MARKDOWN
In the browser, try creating a new item. You should see an alert pop up with your item's value. Let's take
a look at the CreationForm component to see how that works. Open up index.html in your browser, and find the
component. It looks like this:
    MARKDOWN

    source_code :javascript, <<-JAVASCRIPT
      render: function() {
        return (
          <form id="add-form" onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
            <input id='create' ref="description" type='text' placeholder='Add Something to the list!' />
          </form>
        )
      },

      handleSubmit: function(event) {
        event.preventDefault()
        var description = this.refs.description.getDOMNode().value
        this.refs.description.getDOMNode().value = ''
        alert('trying to create an item with description ' + description)
      }
    JAVASCRIPT

    message <<-MARKDOWN
When the form submits, the handleSubmit function runs! This function is preventing the page from refreshing
(using the preventDefault function) and using React to get the new description the user just wrote. See if you
can follow the code – how does the form know to run the handleSubmit function?

Now, let's remove the alert, and instead tell the ListStore to add an item. Your code should look like this:
    MARKDOWN

    source_code :javascript, <<-JAVASCRIPT
      handleSubmit: function(event) {
        event.preventDefault()
        var description = this.refs.description.getDOMNode().value
        this.refs.description.getDOMNode().value = ''
        ListStore.addItem(description)
      }
    JAVASCRIPT
  end

  step do
    message <<-MARKDOWN
Now, let's write the logic for the addItem function. We're going to ask the server to save
this item into the database. Open up store.js, and add the following code to the addItem
function. Replace 'YOUR-LIST-NAME-HERE' with your list's name.
    MARKDOWN

    source_code :javascript, <<-JAVASCRIPT
      addItem: function(itemDescription) {
        var creationRequest = $.ajax({
          type: 'POST',
          url: "http://listalous.herokuapp.com/lists/YOUR-LIST-NAME-HERE/items",
          data: { description: itemDescription, completed: false }
        })
      },
    JAVASCRIPT

    message <<-MARKDOWN
Try creating an item again. After you submit the form, look at the network tab. A
new request should have occurred to http://listalous.herokuapp.com/ !
    MARKDOWN
  end

  step do
    message <<-MARKDOWN
Finally, we need to tell the components to re-render themselves. After the creationRequest,
add the following code:
    MARKDOWN

    source_code :javascript, <<-JAVASCRIPT
      creationRequest.done(function(itemDataFromServer) {
        items.push(itemDataFromServer)
        notifyComponents()
      })
    JAVASCRIPT

    message <<-MARKDOWN
Try creating an item one more time. Once you hit enter, a new item should appear
on the page! If not, flag an instructor down to help you debug the problem.
    MARKDOWN
  end
end

        })

      },

      addItem: function(itemDescription) {

          url: "http://listalous.herokuapp.com/lists/YOUR-LIST-NAME-HERE/items",
          data: { description: itemDescription, completed: false }

### The AJAX process

You've just done something that many JavaScript developers do daily: Use JavaScript
to make a request to a server, and then update the page with the data with which
the server responds. This abstract process is repeated over and over again:

1. Listen for a user action on the page.
2. Parse out the information the user is submitting.
3. Prevent the default action from occuring, if necessary.
4. Make a request to the server using AJAX.
5. When the request succeeds, parse the data the server sends back.
6. Update the page with the newly received data.

This process is the basis of most modern web pages!
