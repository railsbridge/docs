Symbols are, if not unique to Ruby, at least not found in most other languages. 

Symbols help Ruby use memory more efficiently. Every time you store a value in an object, Ruby sets aside a little piece of memory to hold it. If enough memory is tied up, we'll see an effect on performance. Perhaps you've seen your laptop run more and more slowly when lots of programs are open, or seen it speed up when you add more RAM.  

Symbols let Ruby variables point to the same object in several places instead of allocating a new copy.  As a metaphor, think of how a rental car company lets several drivers use the same car instead of buying their own. 

Efficient memory use isn't a concern in simple programs, but it's considered good form . At this stage, focus on recognizing and declaring symbols.  You'll see symbols regularly as you look at code.

How do we know it's the same object? Ruby assigns an object_id number when it creates an object, like a serial number.  These are the same object.

:friday.object_id
:friday.object_id

    message "Ruby allocated a fresh chunk of memory each time, even though the strings says the same thing."

    message <<-CONTENTS
Ruby automatically treats strings, numbers,  and some values as symbols.   

In irb, check the object ids of a word, your lucky number, true and false, and nil.  Check the same value twice to prove it's the same object. ( Tip: to save typing, use the up-arrow key to scroll back through your last irb commands.)
