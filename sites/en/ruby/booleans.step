message "George Boole was an English mathematician who specialized in logic,
especially logic rules involving true and false.  The Boolean datatype
is named in his honor.

In code, as in life, we base a lot of decisions on whether something is true or
false. *\"If it is raining, then I will bring an umbrella; otherwise I will wear
sunglasses.\"*  In the conditionals section we'll make decisions. First we need to look at true and false."

We can also say

- that double equals is easy to mistype as a single equals."
