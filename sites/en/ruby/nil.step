How do you set a variable to empty?  

Some of the values we could use can be legitimate values, like:

`temperature = 0`

`today_is_friday = false`

`empty_phrase = ""`

Nil to the rescue.  Nil means 'nothing'.  It's used to show that a variable hasn't been assigned anything yet, or that a function didn't return a value.
