* **Your laptop.** You need to have a working wifi connection, a browser and an email account you can readily access.
  * If you have a choice between a Mac and a Windows laptop, please bring the Mac.
  * Linux is an acceptable alternative, but the Installfest is only tested on Ubuntu.
* **Power cord for your laptop**
* If you already have accounts on Heroku or GitHub, make sure you know your username and password.

## Possibly also helpful to bring:

* Power strip
* Camera

Even if you get stuck, please go through the rest of the instructions and download all the things you'll need. Bandwidth will be at a premium during the workshop, so it will help immensely to have everything on your laptop already.

There are a lot of steps, and the instructions may seem like they're in a foreign language, but: **don't panic!** By the end of the workshop, you'll know what everything is and how to use it.

You will be installing the following tools:

* **Ruby**. A programming language.
* **Rails**. A framework for making web applications with Ruby. It does a lot of the setting up work for you and creates a model-view-controller structure for your web application. We'll go into more detail about that later.
* **Git**. A revision or source control system. It creates a repository, which is a complete history of your programming changes, so you can undo changes and roll back to previous versions of your work if something has gone wrong.
* **GitHub**. (optional)
* **Heroku**. An application server, which hosts your application during development. This allows you to get your application online and interact with it from any browser, instead of just on your local machine.
* **Sublime Text 2** (or [some other editor](editors)). To write programs in Ruby, you need a text editor to create, edit and save Ruby files.
* Various useful "**Ruby gems**". Ruby gems are useful bits of Ruby code that someone has created for reuse, so you don't have to write it yourself. Including...
  * bundler
  * sqlite

You will also create an account on Heroku, an application hosting platform.

If you already have an account on Heroku, make sure you know your username and password.

If you've already installed the above tools and are confident they are setup correctly, skip ahead to the <a href="get_a_sticker">Get a Sticker</a> step.
