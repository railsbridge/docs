      With Git, there are usually many ways to do very similar things.

        * `git add foo.txt` adds a file named `foo.txt`
        * `git add .` ("git add dot") adds all new files and changed files, but *keeps* files that you've deleted
        * `git add -A` adds everything, including deletions

      "Adding deletions" may sound weird, but if you think of a version control system as keeping track of *changes*, it might make more sense.
