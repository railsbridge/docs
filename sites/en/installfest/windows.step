end

step "Configure your git and ssh environment" do

  important "At the end of the installer there will be a checkbox asking 'Configure git and ssh when installation has completed'. **Leave this box checked.** It will open a terminal window that you need to **type into**."

  message "RailsInstaller made a special Terminal for you to use when you're working on Ruby, Rails, or Git."

    message "The terminal window stores a \"command history.\" To view and re-run previous commands, use the &lt;up arrow&gt; and &lt;down arrow&gt; keys.  You can also edit a previous command and run it -- this is handy for long commands, or fixing mistakes, or for cycles (series of commands) that you repeat."
  end

  tip "Copy and Paste" do

    message "It's usually better to type commands in yourself. It takes a little longer but you learn more."

  end
end

step "Install a Text Editor" do
  message "You need a text editor to do Ruby. If you already have a preferred text editor, such as vi, emacs, jedit, etc., you can skip this step. It must be a plain text editor and not something with styling like Microsoft Word or WordPad."

  message "Notepad is not a good programming editor, but it will work in a pinch."

  important "**When in doubt, use Atom.**"

  message "[Atom](https://atom.io) is a good option, if you don't have one yet."
