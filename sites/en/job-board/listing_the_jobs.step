  # What we're going to do

  * Show the jobs!
  * Learn about ERB

  Going back to the jobs index (<http://localhost:3000/jobs>), we expect to see the new jobs. Let's actually build the job board part of this job board now!

  # Get all the jobs out of the database

  If we're going to show our jobs in view, first we have to get them out of the database and store them in an instance variable. Update the index method to look like this:
MARKDOWN

source_code :ruby,
<<-RUBY
  def index
    @jobs = Job.all
  end
RUBY

message <<-MARKDOWN
  Before we show the jobs, let's actually look at what that is doing. Go back to your Rails console and run `Job.all`.
MARKDOWN

discussion_box "Rails Console", <<-MARKDOWN
  The Rails console is super fun! It's giving us direct access to our local database.

  * Try running `Job.all.to_sql`. What does that do?
  * Try selecting an individual Job record.
  * Try updating an that individual record from the console!

  What is this doing? Go through this line by line, having one person explain each line.

  Compare the ERB to the HTML that shows up on the page. ("Inspect Element" is your friend!)

  What's the difference between a line with `<% %>` brackets and `<%= %>` brackets?
