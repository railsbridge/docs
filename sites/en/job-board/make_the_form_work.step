  So, let's add it:

<<-MARKDOWN
  Familiar error, right? We don't have a template called create.html.erb.

  BUT!!! This time we're not going to make one.

  We actually want to go somewhere useful, right? Let's go back to the main jobs page (where we will eventually be listing our jobs). We need to tell the create method where to go, instead of letting it decide based on method name.

message <<-MARKDOWN
  Okay, now go to <http://localhost:3000/jobs/new> again, and submit a new job.

  Hopefully it went to the right place! But did it do anything?

  Sadly, no. We just took our form contents and dropped them on the ground.

  Arrange your screens so that you can see your server logs (in the terminal window) at the same time as your browser. Now, refresh the form page, and look at what happens in the server. You should see output like `Started GET "/jobs/new"`.

  As a group or in pairs, go over the output of the server, talking through the various pieces of information you see.

  # Saving form data!

  Head back to <http://localhost:3000/jobs/new>, and get your Rails console and your browser next to eachother again. Submit the form again, this time looking for the section that looks something like:

  This is the precious data that our form is sending, and right now we're just throwing it away. Let's not do that! Since we're using Rails 4 and all its great conventions, we're going to use Strong Parameters to limit what kind of data our form can submit to our app.

  Now, submit a new job using the form. What's the count now?

  If the count is going up, yay!!! You got it! If not, time to debug!

  # Tips for Effective Debugging

  * Take a deep breath. Most of your time programming will be looking for bugs.
  * Read the error message out loud. Even if you already think you know what it means.
  * Check every assumption you can think of. You think that something is getting stored in a variable? WHO KNOWS?
    * A good way to check your assumptions is to print out anything you can to the Rails server log. Add puts statements to your code!
    * For example: If the jobs count isn't changing when we make jobs, make the jobs controller look like this. Now, it will print to the console the line "In the create method!!!!" and whatever is being returned from `Job.create(job_params)`
MARKDOWN

source_code :ruby,
<<-RUBY
  def create
    p "In the create method!!!!!!"
    job = Job.create(job_params)
    p job
