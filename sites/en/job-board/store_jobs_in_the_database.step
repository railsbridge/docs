  # Make a jobs model & migration

  In order to make it possible for users to create jobs, we need:

   * A place to store the jobs (a table in the database)
   * Rails to know what a job is (a model)

  We're going to use another Rails generator; this time to make our migration and model!
MARKDOWN

console "rails g model job"

message <<-MARKDOWN
  (The g stands for *generate*, which has many more letters than is necessary to type.)

  That generated two files: a migration and models/job.rb.

  # Make that migration file useful

  Open up the migration file that you just made (cmd+p / ctl+p, type 'create jobs', and hit enter) and you'll see the following:
MARKDOWN

source_code :ruby, <<-RUBY
  class CreateJobs < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      create_table :jobs do |t|

        t.timestamps null: false
      end
    end
  end
RUBY

message <<-MARKDOWN
  Running this code will make a table in our database called jobs. Right now it just has the timestamps (`created_at` and `updated_at`). What else should a job have? Let's start with a title and description.

  Add the the title and description so it looks like this:
MARKDOWN

source_code :ruby, <<-RUBY
  create_table :jobs do |t|
    t.text :title
    t.text :description
    t.timestamps null: false
  end
RUBY

message "Now we need to execute this file, so that the database schema gets updated."

console "rake db:migrate"

message <<-MARKDOWN
  This uses a utility called rake to run a task called `db:migrate`, which in turn looks through all of your migration files and runs any that haven't already been run at some point in the past.
MARKDOWN

discussion_box "Why do we use migrations?",
<<-MARKDOWN
  Talk about the pros and cons of using migrations to update the database, instead of just updating the schema directly. Also, discuss what the database schema is!

  (Pro-tip: *never* update the schema directly.)
MARKDOWN

message <<-MARKDOWN
  # Check out the model

  The migration we just ran updated the database, but that doesn't mean that we can talk to the database using Ruby yet. Look at the file `app/models/job.rb`. The `Job` class inherits from ActiveRecord::Base, so that we can talk to the database with Ruby instead of SQL!

  Okay, so we've got some place to store our jobs. But how can we make any? THROUGH THE MAGIC OF FORMS!!!
