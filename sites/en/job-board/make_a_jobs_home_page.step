  # What we're going to do:

  * Play follow-the-error to guide our development
  * Add routes, a controller, and a view to make a home page
  * Learn how to read the routing info at <http://localhost:3000/rails/info>

  # Getting Started

  That Rails default page is boring. Let's add a page to list the open jobs at RailsBridgeCorp!

  To start, let's visit the page that we want to put our jobs on: <http://localhost:3000/jobs>.
MARKDOWN

error_box "No route matches [GET] '/jobs'"

message <<-MARKDOWN
  That's pretty reasonable, since we currently don't have any routes at all right now.

  # Adding Routes

  So it's looking for a route, but can't find one. Let's add one!

  Open up the routes file. It's in the config directory, called `routes.rb`. If you're using Sublime Text 2, you can open it using keyboard shortcuts:

   * Hitting cmd + p (on Mac) or ctl + p (on PC)
   * typing in `route`
   * hitting enter

  Magic! (Sublime is using fuzzy search, so you can use the entire file path, or just part of the filename to go to files.)
MARKDOWN

source_code_with_message "We're going to need a resource route, which will create EIGHT different routes for us. Add this to line two:", :ruby, "resources :jobs"

message <<-MARKDOWN
  Now, lets go look at what that made, by using the excellently helpful page available on any Rails 4 app: <http://localhost:3000/rails/info>.
MARKDOWN

discussion_box "How to read the routes page.", <<-MARKDOWN
  In your browser, visit <http://localhost:3000/rails/info>. Go over each of the columns and how to read it.

  * Helper
  * HTTP Verb (don't worry about going to in-depth with these yet)
  * Path
  * Controller#Action

  Why does the Helper column sometimes not have anything?

  Can you find the line that will make `/jobs` a route?
MARKDOWN

tip "If you are on Rails 3, going to /rails/info will **fail**! Stop right now and upgrade to Rails 4."

message <<-MARKDOWN
  Since adding the line `resources :jobs` made a route matching `/jobs`, let's go visit that page again: <http://localhost:3000/jobs>
MARKDOWN

error_box "uninitialized constant JobsController"

message <<-MARKDOWN
  Why does Rails now think it needs a JobsController?

  # Add a controller

  Time for a shortcut!!! Unlike the scaffold that we make in Suggestotron that makes about a million different files, we're just going to use a Rails generator to make the files we need.
MARKDOWN

console "rails generate controller jobs"

discussion_box "What did that command do?", <<-MARKDOWN
  What files were made by that last command? Are they awesome?

  How will this change what error we see when we go to the jobs page?
MARKDOWN

message "Now: refresh <http://localhost:3000/jobs>"

error_box "The action 'index' could not be found for JobsController"

message <<-MARKDOWN
  What is telling Rails to look in JobsController?

  Let's go back to <http://localhost:3000/rails/info> again and look at what controller and method (AKA action) the route /jobs is pointing to.

  It's looking for a method called index on the jobs controller! Since there isn't a controller method for this route, we'll need to add it.

  Open up your jobs controller (again, try to use keyboard shortcuts: cmd+p on Mac or ctl+p on PC to find the file at app/controllers/jobs_controller.rb).
MARKDOWN

source_code_with_message "Add the index method to the controller:", :ruby,

message "And refresh <http://localhost:3000/jobs>"

error_box "Missing template jobs/index, application/index with {:locale=>[:en], :formats=>[:html], :handlers=>[:erb, :builder, :raw, :ruby, :jbuilder, :coffee]}. Searched in: * '/Users/probablyyou/railsbridge/job_board/app/views'"

message <<-MARKDOWN
  What's the important part of the this error? How does Rails decide to look for something called jobs/index? How did it decide to look in the views directory?

  Talk through what Rails is trying, and failing, to do, and how file names and method names are important here.

  # Add a view

  Within app/views/jobs, add a file called index.html.erb.

  Save that file, and refresh <http://localhost:3000/jobs>

  NO ERROR!?!?! How boring. Let's add some content so we can be more confident that this really a thing.
MARKDOWN

source_code_with_message "Within index.html.erb, add this (or the name of your fictional megacorp):", :html, "<h1>RailsBridgeCorp Open Jobs</h1>"

message <<-MARKDOWN
  DONE! Well, except that we don't have any jobs. And even though we could hand-code a table of job titles here, that would be awfully tedious and we'd probably get sick of adding job postings every time someone came up with a new volunteer position. Let's empower people to add their own postings!
