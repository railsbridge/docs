  Okay, so that's awesome. Now we just have to add a form for editing. I wonder if it is any different from the create form? I guess we could copy and paste the other form?

  We could copy and paste from the other form, but we try to avoid that because duplicated code is hard to maintain. For example, if I want to add placeholder text for the inputs in the form, when the code is duplicated, I’ll need to update the code in each place the form was copied. (In large apps it’s easy to miss a place that would need to be updated.) The solution is to reuse rather than duplicate the code, and the way to reuse code in views is by using partials.

  # Create a Partial

  Rails form helpers are designed beautifully for CRUD interfaces. So we're not gonna have to write very much code to make this form work for editing AND creating job postings.

  But first, a refactor: we're going to move the create form into a partial.

  (Refactoring is improving code while maintaining the behavior it produces.)

  Make a new file under jobs like so: `app/views/jobs/_form.html.erb`, and move the following code OUT of `app/views/jobs/new.html.erb` and into the `_form.html.erb` file:
MARKDOWN

source_code :erb,
<<-ERB
  <%= form_for @job do |f| %>
    <div>
      <%= f.label :title %>
      <%= f.text_field :title %>
    </div>
    <div>
      <%= f.label :description %>
      <%= f.text_area :description, size: '60x6' %>
    </div>
    <div>
      <%= f.submit %>
    </div>
  <% end %>
ERB

source_code_with_message "Now, in `app/views/jobs/new.html.erb`, add the following line:", :erb,
<<-ERB
  <%= render "form" %>
ERB

message <<-MARKDOWN
  Add a job posting, just to make sure that the form is working as expected.

  # Use the power of partials
MARKDOWN

source_code_with_message "Now that we have a form partial, we can reuse it! In `app/views/jobs/edit.html.erb`, we can add the same line under the header:", :erb,
<<-ERB
<%= render "form" %>
ERB

message "Refresh the page."

error_box "First argument in form cannot contain nil or be empty"
source_code_with_message "It looks like we don't have a job ... because we haven't gotten our job out of the database! Let's go to the jobs_controller and fix that. In jobs_controller.rb, add the following", :ruby,

  def edit
    @job = Job.find(params[:id])
  end

  # Actually Update The Job

  So now the form works. Let's try to update that job posting. Change something about the job posting, and submit the form.
MARKDOWN

error_box "The action 'update' could not be found for JobsController"

source_code_with_message "So it looks like the form is finding the right route, but the method is missing from the controller. Let's add the update method to the file jobs_controller.rb", :ruby,

  end

discussion_box "What is this controller method missing?", <<-MARKDOWN
  Who knows what we're missing?

  Take a look at the `create` method on the jobs controller and compare what we're doing in each.

  See if you can figure it out as a class.

  We needed to save our changes to the database so they can actually persist! If you didn't have the discussion before and work out the answer, go through this method line-by-line explaining precisely what the code is doing.

  ### Add a Link

  Our users probably aren't going to know they can hit `/jobs/:id/edit` to visit the edit form, so let's add a link to it on the jobs index so we end up with this (we're just adding the line with the `<h5>` header in it ... don't copy and paste the whole thing!):
MARKDOWN

source_code :erb,
<<-ERB
  <% @jobs.each do |job| %>
    <h3><%= job.title %></h3>
    <p><%= job.description %></p>
    <h5><%= link_to "Edit Posting", edit_job_path(job)%></h5>
  <% end %>
