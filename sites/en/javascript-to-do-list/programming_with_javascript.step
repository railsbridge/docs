JavaScript is a fully featured programming language with variables, loops,
and conditionals. Just like Ruby, Java, Python, and PHP, you can use JavaScript
to do math, model large systems, and perform complex calculations – all in your browser!
In this lesson, we'll learn about the fundamentals of the JavaScript programming language.

Press enter. Your browser should now look like this:

Congrats, you just wrote your first lines of JavaScript code! __console.log__ is an important function –
it allows you to print information to the browser's console. It's very helpful in debugging! You can also
use the __alert__ function to make a message pop up in the browser. Try it out!

Objects can also have __functions__, which can be helpful for altering objects and learning more about them.
Functions are __invoked__ with parentheses, which causes them to run.

    message <<-MARKDOWN
The __push__ function allows us to add new items to an array. the slice function returns a new array with
with everything to the right of the __index__ we provided. Here, we passed the function the number 1, so
slice returned an array with everything after the first element in the array. (Note that the first element is assigned 0 as its index rather than 1).)
