## What are attributes?

HTML tags give the browser information about their content, like whether it's header text, or a paragraph, or a list.
**Attributes** are extra information included with the tag, such as the URL for a link tag, or the location of a file
for an image tag.

Form elements use an attribute to tell the browser what type of input they are,
so the results will be easy to tell apart. This input:

  MARKDOWN
  source_code :html, "<input type='radio' name='rando-radio'>"
  message <<-MARKDOWN

looks like a radio button: <input type='radio' name='rando-radio'>, but

  MARKDOWN
  source_code :html, "<input type='password' name='fake-password' value='ick'>"
  message <<-MARKDOWN

looks like a password text input: <input type='password' name='rando-radio' value='ick'> even though they use the same **tag**.

## IDs and Classes

Two of the most important attributes that an element can have are its `id` and its `class`. With these attributes,
we can assign names to elements and groups of elements, then apply CSS styles using the names we give them.

MARKDOWN

  source_code :html, <<-MARKDOWN
  <p id='intro' class='special'>
    This is my intro paragraph!
  </p>
MARKDOWN

  message <<-MARKDOWN
In our CSS, we use special syntax to tell the browser if we're talking about an ID or a class name. IDs are indicated with a
hash, like this: `#intro`. Classes are indicated with a dot: `.special`
  MARKDOWN

  tip do  message <<-MARKDOWN
## When should I use a class, and when should I use an ID?

**ID** attributes are unique labels, for identifying things you'll only ever have one
of. For example, if you ran a news website, you might have a masthead element
that only appears once, so you could give it an id
like `handsome-header`.

**Class** attributes should be used to group together similar elements; for example, you might give certain
paragraphs a class of `special` and use that class to highlight them.

In general, only use `id` if you're certain that it will only appear on a single element. For everything else,
use `class`.

  MARKDOWN
  end
  message <<-MARKDOWN

Let's look at IDs and classes in action. So far we've only applied styles to HTML tags like `<p>` and `<h1>`. But what if we want to apply a style to only a few of the instances of a given tag? We don't want _every_ paragraph to look special, so we can't add our style directly to the `<p>` tag.

  step do
    message "Let's add some classes and ids to our HTML. Start by adding one or two more paragraphs of text to the bottom of your HTML document. The last lines might look like this:"

<p>I like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Polka Dots</li>

    message "Add the class 'special' to your first paragraph. It'll look something like this:"
    source_code :html, <<HTML
<h1>Hello <em>World</em>!</h1>
<p class="special">My name is Rachel.</p>
<p>I like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Polka Dots</li>

  end

  step do
    message "To add a style rule that will apply to a class, use the syntax `.class-name` for your selector. It will be almost the same as the styles that you added to `<h1>` and `<p>`, but with a period at the beginning of your class name."

    source_code :css, <<CSS

  border: 1px solid green;
}
CSS
    message "Refresh the page in the browser. You'll see something like this:"
    img src: 'img/css_class.png'
  end

  step do
    message "Let's wrap your name in a `span` tag and give that an ID of 'user-name'. It'll look something like this:"

  <span id="user-name">Rachel</span>

    source_code :css, <<CSS

  font-weight: bold;
}
CSS
    message <<-MARKDOWN
(Note: The span is just an element that lets you apply a class, id, or other attribute to a string of text without adding any line breaks. Browsers won't give it any styling by default.)

Once you add your style rule and refresh the page in the browser, you'll see something rather ugly like this:
    MARKDOWN
    img src: 'img/css_id.png'
  end

end


explanation do
  message <<-MARKDOWN
Attributes let us add extra information to an HTML tag. IDs and classes are specific types of attributes that let us
give names to our elements.

CSS uses special syntax to indicate if we're using an ID, a class, or just the tag itself in our style.
