## What is Git?

Git is an open-source tool for tracking and managing changes to source code. If you've
used tools like SVN or CVS, you can use Git to do the same things.

Git is not required for front end development at all &mdash; some people use other source
control tools like SVN, and there are wild and crazy coders who don't use source control
at all.

### But here are some good reasons to use a source control system:

* You can commit different/earlier versions of a project, and get them back
  later if you change your mind.
* It's easy to also copy these versions to another server or computer, so you
  have a backup if your laptop is stolen or your hard drive gets damaged.
* Other coders can more easily work on a project with you. Source control
  systems have an automated way to 'merge' or combine changed files together.

### And there are some neat things about Git specifically:

* Git is distributed. Each person or computer working on the project has a full
  copy of it. There isn't a remote server you have to connect to that has the
  'official' copy somewhere.
* Git makes it easy to 'branch' or work separately for a while on an alternate
  version of the project, and then 'merge' those changes back in if you want to.
* Git is ultra-powerful, and even many experienced developers are mystified
  by its wily ways.

## What is Github?

Github is a web application that will store copies of your git repositories for you.
It's a convenient place to keep a backup of your projects, and it has a nice-looking
web interface that makes it easy to see your files and changes.

Projects that you make public (i.e. open source) can be stored on Github for free.
