### Goal

This curriculum is meant to introduce the javascript programming language. It builds on the <a href="/frontend">Front End RailsBridge Curriculum</a>. Anyone familiar with HTML, will be able to work through this curriculum.

In the workshop, we will:

* Learn about and use the primitive types of javascript, 
* Learn about and use functions and callbacks,
* Understand scope, and the changing value of the keyword 'this'
* Use javascript to create a simple single page application.
* Use git to version control our application.

This is just a rough guideline, not a mandate. Some steps you'll go over and some you'll go under. It'll all work out by the end of the day. :D

### Requirements

We're going to be working with:

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
  (If you're experienced with the developer tools in another browser, that may work too.)
* The code editor of your choice.
  [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is popular and free to download, but you should buy a license if you keep using it after the workshop.
  [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit) is a good open source option, if you don't have one yet.

Optional tools if you're checking in to GitHub: 

* Git
* Your [GitHub](http://github.com) account
