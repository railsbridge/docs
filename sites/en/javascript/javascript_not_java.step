### JavaScript is not Java

JavaScript, which was created at Netscape in 1995, was originally called LiveScript but was renamed around the same time that Java was becoming a popular new programming language.
But the two are different.

Whereas Java was meant to run on the server, JavaScript was originally meant to run in the browser and allow the user to manipulate the web document after it was loaded. Nowadays it is also being used as a server-side language.

### HTML and JavaScript

HTML lets you create the elements in your document (web page). JavaScript lets you interact with them. The curriculum that follows assumes an understanding of HTML. If you need more background info, please see the <a href="/frontend">Railsbridge Frontend Curriculum</a>.
