## Strings
Strings are units of text, and we encapsulate them in `'single quotes'` or `"double quotes"`.

MARKDOWN

steps do
  step { message "Try creating a string by typing `'this is a string'` into the console prompt."}
  step { message "You can grab a string's individual characters with `'this is a string'[6]`, where the number 6 is the index of the character you want, starting at 0."}
  step { message "Concatenate strings with `'my name is' + 'Michelle' + '.'`."}
  step { message "Assign a string to a variable by writing `myName = 'Michelle'`."}
  step { message "Use the variable as you would a literal string: `'Is your name ' + myName + '?'`"}
  step { message "If you're ahead of others, check out the [MDN docs on strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)."}

## Booleans (True/False)
Booleans are a type of object used to indicate true or false values in Javascript. They are most often used to help check whether a condition is true or not, or whether something exists.

MARKDOWN

steps do
  step {message "Try creating a Boolean by typing `'x = false'`."}
  step {message "`Type x == false ? console.log('yes') : console.log('no');`"}
