### Download the tutorial

Today, we're going to recreate the classic game Snake in the Javascript programming language.

Before you can start the tutorial, you'll need to [download the tutorial](/js-snake-game-tutorial.zip)download the tutorial</a> to your computer to edit the source code.

Once you have these tools available, we need to open the files we'll be working with:
  * Open game/snake.js in your text editor
  * Open game/index.html in your browser
  * Open your browsers javascript console
  * To test that your console is working, try typing `alert("hello world");` in your browser's javascript console and dismiss the window that pops up.

### Using the Browser's Console

We'll experiment with javascript using the console of our browser. We recommend everyone use Chrome, for consistency through the class.

To open the console on a Mac, use the shortcut `Command` + `Option` + `J`. To open the console in Windows or Linux, use the keyboard shortcut `Control` + `Shift` + `J`. Alternatively, right click, select 'Inspect Element' from the right-click menu, and click the 'Console' tab.

The console is where we can experiment with javascript, by typing after the `>` prompt. The console will also show us the return value of an expression we type and will display any errors we get.


### Stop and reflect

* The javascript console is one of the fastest ways to get feedback on
  whether the code does what you expect. How else can you get feedback about if
  your code does what you expect?
* Why shouldn't you use Word or Google Docs to edit code?
