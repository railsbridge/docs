  h1 "Model View Controller (MVC) Architecture"

  message "Rails implements a very specific notion of the **Model/View/Controller** pattern, which guides how you structure your web applications."

  h2 "Controller"
  message <<-MARKDOWN
  * When you visit any page in your application, that request will be handled by a method in a Controller.
  * Controllers use the Models to create, read, update, and delete data from the database.
  * Controllers pass Ruby objects to the Views.

      <code>def</code>) for each of the views listed above (except
      _form.html.erb)."

  h2 "Model"
  message <<-MARKDOWN
  * The Model is a bridge between the database and your application's code.
  * For all the Models we create in RailsBridge, Model objects have a corresponding record in the database. The name of the table in the database is the plural version of the Model's class name.

  h2 "View"
  message <<-MARKDOWN
  * The View generates the HTML that will be displayed in the browser.
  * View files are written in ERB, a templating language. It contains HTML with Ruby code embedded in it. The ruby variables in the view stand as placeholders for content that will be filled in when a user requests the page.

  The file **`app/views/topics/index.html.erb`** in your **text editor (Sublime)**:

  ![Screenshot of topic index view file in Sublime](img/Topics_Index_File_Viewed_In_Sublime.png)

  Creates this **page** in your **web browser**:

  message "You may have noticed that the page for new topics and the page to edit topics looked similar. That's because they both use the
  code from this file to show a form. This file is called a
  partial since it only contains code for part of a page. Partials
  always have filenames starting with an underscore character."
