  message <<-MARKDOWN
    At the core, most database driven web sites are the same. They need to store records and provide a way to do the following:

    * **C**reate new records in the database
    * **R**ead or show the records in the database
    * **U**pdate existing records
    * **D**estroy or delete records

    Because these 4 actions (CRUD) are so common, Rails includes the scaffold command to make creating them easier.

  tip "Now is a good time to figure out how to have multiple tabs or windows of your terminal or command prompt. Starting and stopping the Rails server all day is tedious, so it's good to have one terminal tab or window for running commands, and a separate one for the server."
  tip "Docker users should have a tab that is running rails server, `docker-compose up`, a tab that is running bash in the docker web service container, `docker-compose run web bash`, where you can run all your rails related commands and `irb`, and another tab to interact with git, heroku, or bringing down the server, `docker-compose down`."

      * Try the "show", "edit", and "destroy" links to see what they do
      * You've created a basic database-driven web site. Congratulations!

  How did all those pages get created and hooked together? `rails scaffold` did it for you.
