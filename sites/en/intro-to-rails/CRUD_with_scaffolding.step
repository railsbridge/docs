    At the core, most database driven web sites are the same. They need to store records and provide a way to do the following:

    * **C**reate new records in the database
    * **R**ead or show the records in the database
    * **U**pdate existing records
    * **D**estroy or delete records

    Because these 4 actions (CRUD) are so common, Rails includes the scaffold command to make creating them easier.

    console "rails server"
    tip "Now is a good time to figure out how to have multiple tabs or windows of your terminal or command prompt. Starting and stopping the Rails server all day is tedious, so it's good to have one terminal tab or window for running commands, and a separate one for the server."

  step {
    message <<-MARKDOWN
  * Click on "New Topic"
  * Fill in the form and click "Create Topic"
  * You should see a page showing your new topic with a message that your topic was successfully created:

    img alt: "Screenshot of topic detail page with confirmation message", src: "img/Seattle_topic_created.png"
  }

  step {
    message <<-MARKDOWN
      * Click on "Back"
      * You should see the topic list again, this time with your new topic listed:

      ![Screenshot of topic list with new topic](img/Seattle_list_with_topic.png)

      * Try the "show", "edit", and "destroy" links to see what they do
      * You've created a basic database-driven web site. Congratulations!

  How did all those pages get created and hooked together? `rails scaffold` did it for you.
