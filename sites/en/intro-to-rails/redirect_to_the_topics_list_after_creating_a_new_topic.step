  When a user creates a new topic, or edits an existing topic, they are
  currently shown a page with just that topic. For our voting app it makes
  more sense that they would be taken back to the topic list.

  In this step we'll change the flow of our app so that the user is taken back to the topics list after they add a new topic (create) or
  edit an existing topic (update).

    message <<-MARKDOWN
    Adding this line will ensure that the `notice` message we included
    in the `TopicsController` will show up in your `index` view.
    You can add this line wherever you want the messages to show up on the
    page. Experiment with adding it in different places in your `index` view.

explanation {

  message <<-MARKDOWN
  * `format.html { redirect_to topics_path, notice: 'Topic was successfully created.' }`:
    * `format.html` means that the server should send HTML back to the browser
    * `redirect_to topics_path` means show the **topics list page** when we're done creating or updating a topic
    * `notice: 'Topic was successfully created/updated.'` puts the message into the flash so it will be displayed on the topics list
