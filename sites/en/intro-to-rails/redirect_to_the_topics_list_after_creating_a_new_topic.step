  When a user creates a new topic, or edits an existing topic, they are

  In this step we'll change the flow of our app so that the user is taken back to the topics list after they add a new topic (create) or

  message <<-MARKDOWN
  * `format.html { redirect_to topics_path, notice: 'Topic was successfully created.' }`:
    * `format.html` means that the server should send html back to the browser
    * `redirect_to topics_path` means show the **topics list page** when we're done creating or updating a topic
    * `notice: 'Topic was successfully created/updated.'` puts the message into the flash so it will be displayed on the topics list
