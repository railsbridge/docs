# Working Effectively and Efficiently

We highly recommend you do the following:

* Bring up your terminal and open 2 tabs:
  * One is for regular terminal stuffs
  * One will be for irb (a.k.a. Rails console). We'll explain later.
* Open your browser fresh or hide any windows you already have open.
  * Bring up one window with two tabs
    * One for this content
    * One for interacting with your app.
* Open your text editor and _do not ever close it_. We're not quitters.
* Hide all extra applications. Turn off Twitter, IM, and all other distractions.

By minimizing the number of things you interact with, you reduce the
amount of time spent switching between them and the context lost as
you work through the lessons. Having 50 tabs open in your web
browser gets confusing and wastes time.
