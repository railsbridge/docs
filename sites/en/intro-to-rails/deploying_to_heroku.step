  message <<-MARKDOWN
  First, we had to do some work to make Heroku happy with our application. This
required updating the `Gemfile` and bundling.

  * The `Gemfile` is a list of all the Ruby libraries your application needs.
    What we've declared here is that we want to use the `sqlite3` library
    while we're developing on our computer (the development group) but when
    deploying to Heroku (the production group) we want to use the `pg` library,
    which is made for the type of database that Heroku uses.

  * Bundler is how Ruby projects keep track of the gems that they use. We told
    Bundler what we wanted to use in the `Gemfile`, now we need to make sure those
    gems are installed. Since we don't have the type of database Heroku does, we
    skip the production gems. Don't worry though! Bundler still logs them so
    Heroku will install them when they get your code.
