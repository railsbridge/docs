message <<-MARKDOWN

Everything should be set up the night before during our
install-fest. Please ensure you have everything working _before_ you
show up for RailsBridge on Saturday.

We will be working with:

* Ruby 2.1 or 2.2 installed via RVM (Mac or Linux) or RailsInstaller (Windows)
* Rails 4.2.x
* Bundler
* SQLite
* A text editor


You can verify that you have everything working by trying this out in your terminal:

<div class="console"><pre>
$ irb
>> 1 + 2
=> 3
>> require "active_support"
=> true
>> exit
$
</pre>
</div>

If you can do that, you are probably good to go.
