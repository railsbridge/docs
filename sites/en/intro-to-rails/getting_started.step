Open the suggestotron folder as a project in your text editor.

In **Sublime Text 2**, you can use the `Project > Add Folder to Project...` menu option:

Select your `suggestotron` folder from the file picker that opens. If everything works out Sublime should show the directories of your app in a tree structure on the left:
