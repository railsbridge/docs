# Lesson 6 - Snake can move in every direction

markdown <<-MARKDOWN
  Now that the snake is moving on it's own, let's make it so it can move in
  different directions!

  First, we'll create a function that moves the segment based upon it's
  direction (down, up, right, left):

  ```js
  var moveSegment = function(segment) {
    if (segment.direction === "down") {
      return { top: segment.top + 1, left: segment.left }
    } else if (segment.direction === "up") {
      return { top: segment.top - 1, left: segment.left }
    } else if (segment.direction === "right") {
      return { top: segment.top, left: segment.left + 1 }
    } else if (segment.direction === "left") {
      return { top: segment.top, left: segment.left - 1 }
    }
    return segment;
  }
  ```

  `if` statements choose what code to run. Here a series of `if` and `else if`s
  to return a new object with coordinates offset from the passed in segment.

  When the passed in segment doesn't have a direction or it doesn't match the
  directions in our `if`/`else if` then we return the original segment object.

  Our returned segment doesn't have a direction; which means the snake will
  only move once! To keep the snake moving we need to assign every `newSegment` a
  direction.

  Let's change our `moveSnake` function to give the `newSegment` the same
  direction as the `oldSegment`. This will keep the snake moving in the same
  direction.

  ```js
  var moveSnake = function(snake) {
    var oldSegment = snake[0];
    var newSegment = moveSegment(oldSegment);
    newSegment.direction = oldSegment.direction;
    var newSnake = [newSegment];
    return newSnake;
  }
  ```

  Next add a direction to our initial snakes segments.

  ```js
  var snake = [{ top: 0, left: 0, direction: "down" }];
  ```

  Now our snake knows where to start moving!

  ### Play Time!

  * Use a switch statement instead of a series of ifs
  * Make sure each direction works!

  ### Syntax Breakdown

  `===` tells the computer to check for EXACT equality. For example: "down" === "down" will return true but "down" === "DOWN" will return false.
