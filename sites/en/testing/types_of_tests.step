  Now, that you know what tests are, let's discuss the different types of tests!

  In your Rails app, you have models, views, and controllers. It should be no surprise that tests can be written for models, views, and controllers.

  As you learned in the previous section, tests are used to verify that your code is working as expected. So, a couple things we can test right off the bat are that a tree should have certain associations and validations. Let's start by writing some model tests also known as unit tests! This link might come in handy to remember singular vs. plural Rails conventions: https://alexander-clark.com/blog/rails-conventions-singular-or-plural/

      Last but not least: view tests! Below is an short snippet of a possible Orange show HTML page you can create in your app:
    MARKDOWN

    source_code :erb, <<-ERB
      <br>
      Orange title: <%= @orange.name %>
      <br>
      <br>
      Orange tree id: <%= @orange.tree_id %>
      <br>
    ERB

    message <<-MARKDOWN
      So, based on the orange you create, the show page should render HTML with the orange's name and tree id. Let's verify that with a few tests.
    MARKDOWN

    message "First, create a views folder in the spec folder. Then, create an oranges folder in the views folder. Lastly, create an oranges view spec file in the oranges folder. Type these commands in the terminal:"

    console_without_message "cd app/spec/views/oranges"
    console_without_message "touch show.html.erb_spec.rb"
  end
  step do
    message "Then, run rspec."

    console_without_message "bundle exec rspec"

    message "You should see a report with some passing tests but those are just the model and controller tests you wrote. So, let's add some view tests!"
    message "We're going to up the ante a bit here and NOT show you an example :) Google and StackOverflow are your friends here!"
  end
end

  Once, you have written some passing view tests, take a deep breath and pat yourself on the back! Testing is hard. But, it's critical in making sure software is stable and functional.

  So, I fibbed a little bit. There are more types of tests than just MVC tests. One of these other important tests is called an integration test. As the name indicates, it tries to assess how well multiple components in an app interact and is written in Rails as a feature spec test. Typically, these tests simulate a user and a user's actions to test end-to-end functionality.

  Here's a diagram from Thoughtbot that may help with understanding how integration tests fit in:

  Capybara is a common framework used to write integration tests in Rails. It integrates nicely with RSpec such that you can use the same kind of test language to write integration tests.

  As an added bonus for this section, write an integration test :)
