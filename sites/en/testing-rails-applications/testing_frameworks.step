# What's a testing framework?
A testing framework is an execution environment for automated tests. Testing frameworks help teams organize their test suites and in turn
help improve the efficiency of testing.

# Types of testing frameworks
There are many testing frameworks that work great. Minitest is the default testing framework in Rails 5. However, we will be using the RSpec testing framework instead.


# RSpec
## How to set up RSpec in Rails

First, create a new Rails app. 

<div class="console"><pre>
rails new testapp
</pre>
</div>

Then, add rspec-rails to both the :development and :test groups in the Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rspec-rails', '~> 3.4'
end
```

Download and install by running:

<div class="console"><pre>
bundle install
</pre>
</div>

Initialize the spec/ directory (where specs will reside) with:

<div class="console"><pre>
rails generate rspec:install
</pre>
</div>

This command will add the spec helper, rails helper, and .rspec configuration files.

Use the rspec command to run your specs:

<div class="console"><pre>
bundle exec rspec
</pre>
</div>

By default, the above code will run all spec files in the spec directory.

To run only a subset of these specs use the following command:

<div class="console"><pre>
# Run only a specific folder name
bundle exec rspec spec/folder_name

# Run only specs for a specific type of test such as the post controller
bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/post_controller_spec.rb
</pre>
</div>

## RSpec Basics

```ruby
RSpec.describe Tree do
 it "is able to age by 1 year increments" do
   orange_tree = Tree.new
   orange_tree.age
   expect(orange_tree.age).to eq(1)
 end
end
```

The 'describe' and 'it' methods come from rspec-core. The Tree class would be from your code. You can think of 'describe' as a header to describe which class you are testing and 'it' as a string/subheader that states what specifically you are testing in the Tree class. Note: you may or may not need the RSpec in front of the describe depending on your RSpec version.

The last line of the example expresses an expected outcome. If orange_tree.age == 1, then the example passes. If not, it fails with a message like:

<div class="console">
<pre>
expected: #< Tree @age=1 >
     got: #< Tree @age=0 >
</pre>
</div>

## Matchers
Remember our example in the RSpec Basics section above? The 'to eq' is a matcher! RSpec has many built-in matchers. Matchers evaluates our expectations. In our example, we are saying that we expect orange_tree's age to equal an integer of 1.

# minitest
In case you were curious to see how tests are written in minitest. Minitest also allows you to write tests in 'expectation style' which is very similar to how RSpec tests are written.

```ruby
class TestTree < Minitest::Test
  def setup
    @orange_tree = Tree.new
    @orange_tree.age
  end

  def test_age_by_one_year_increments
    assert_equal 1, @orange_tree.age
  end
end
```

To run the test enter the following in Terminal/Command Prompt:

<div class="console">
<pre>
ruby tree_test.rb
</pre>
</div>

Once you run the test this is how the test looks like:
<div class="console">
<pre>
$ ruby tree_test.rb
Run options: --seed 30102

</div>
