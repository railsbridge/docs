# RailsBridge curriculum-related FAQ

### Can I use the RailsBridge curricula at my event?

Anyone can use this site! It's under a Creative Commons license ([CC-BY,  specifically](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)), which means you're welcome to share, remix, or use our content commercially. We just ask for attribution.

Slightly different: if you're organizing an event and wonder if it could be considered a RailsBridge Workshop, we just have two requests:

* The event should be free of charge.
* The event should work toward making tech more welcoming!

If you're not doing those two things, you can totally still use the site, we just ask that you not call your event a RailsBridge workshop.
(Charity workshops have used "Rails Workshop featuring the RailsBridge curriculum" in the past, which is neat.)


### I want to help, but I don't know how.

First, [make a GitHub account](https://github.com/). Then, [create an issue](https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/issues) with the idea you have. We'll help you turn it into reality (assuming it's in line with our lofty goals :D).

Don't know what you could work on? Browse the [issues list](https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/issues) and the [To Do list](https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/wiki/RailsBridge-To-Do-List). Those have lots of ideas.


### I have a different question about RailsBridge.

The [RailsBridge website](http://www.railsbridge.org) probably has an answer!
