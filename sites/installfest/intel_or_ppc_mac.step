PowerPC (PPC) Macs are Apple's older line of machines with Motorola chips. Macs purchased since 2006 are almost all Intel. To find out for sure:

* Click on the Apple menu in the top left corner of your screen.
* Select "About this Mac."
* It should have a line that starts with "Processor." If somewhere in that line it says "Intel," then you have an Intel Mac. Otherwise, you have a PPC Mac.
