note <<-MARKDOWN

Ok, there is one more step. You won't be using the test application in the workshop; we just created it to make sure everything was working. **You should delete it now to reduce confusion during the workshop.** Don't worry about losing information - you'll repeat all the steps tomorrow, but more slowly so you can better understand what's going on under the hood.
