RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager and is the easiest way to install and manage Ruby.  The [official RVM install instructions](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/) are available here, but this should work for you:
MARKDOWN

step "Install RVM" do
  console "curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable"
  message "This will do some stuff and print a long message which you can ignore."  
end

step "Configure your shell" do

  message "Every time you open a new terminal window, rvm will be active inside it. Close your terminal window and open a new one."

  verify do
    console "type rvm | head -1"
    result "rvm is a function"

    console "rvm -v"
    result "rvm 1.14.5 (stable) by Wayne E. Seguin (wayneeseguin@gmail.com) [https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/]"
  end
  
end

step "Install Ruby 1.9.3 using RVM" do
  console "rvm install 1.9.3"

  message "This downloads and compiles Ruby, which takes a while."
  
  important "[Mac OS only] If `rvm install 1.9.3` says `autoreconf was not found in the PATH` then run

      brew install automake
      
  and retry."
  
  important "[Ubuntu only] If `rvm install 1.9.3` says `autoreconf was not found in the PATH` then run

rvm use 1.9.3
rvm --default use 1.9.3

    console "ruby -v"
    result "1.9.3"
