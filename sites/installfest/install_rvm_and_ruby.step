message <<-MARKDOWN
RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager and is the easiest way to install and manage Ruby.  The [official RVM install instructions](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/) are available here, but this should work for you:
MARKDOWN

step "Install RVM" do
  console "curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable"
  message "This will do some stuff and print a long message which you can ignore."  
end

step "Configure your shell" do

  message "Every time you open a new terminal window, rvm will be active inside it. Close your terminal window and open a new one."

  verify do
    console "type rvm | head -1"
    result "rvm is a function"

    console "rvm -v"
    result "rvm 1.14.5 (stable) by Wayne E. Seguin (wayneeseguin@gmail.com) [https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/]"
  end
  
end

step "Install Ruby 1.9.3 using RVM" do
  console "rvm install 1.9.3"
  
  important "If you get an entire page of instructions, beginning with 'Ruby (and needed base gems) for your selection...', you should press Q to skip."

  message "This downloads and compiles Ruby, which takes a while."
  
  important "If `rvm install 1.9.3` says `autoreconf was not found in the PATH`" do
    option "Mac OS" do
      console "brew install automake"
    end

    option "Ubuntu Linux" do
      console "sudo apt-get install automake"
    end

    message "Once that completes, retry `rvm install 1.9.3`"
  end  

  console <<-BASH
rvm use 1.9.3
rvm --default use 1.9.3
  BASH

  verify do
    console "ruby -v"
    result "ruby 1.9.3p327 (2012-11-10 revision 37606) [x86_64-darwin11.4.2]"
  end
end
