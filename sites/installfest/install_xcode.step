message "**Special note for folks who upgraded from Leopard to Snow Leopard:** The SQLite gem does not compile with an older version of XCode installed. If you upgraded your machine from an older version of OS X, and you have an older XCode, you still need to reinstall it from your **Snow Leopard** DVD.
