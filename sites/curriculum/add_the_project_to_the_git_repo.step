      message <<-MARKDOWN
  With Git, there are usually many ways to do very similar things.

    * `git add foo.txt` adds a file named `foo.txt`
    * `git add .` adds all new files and changed files, but *keeps* files that you've deleted
    * `git add -A` adds everything, including deletions

"Adding deletions" may sound weird, but if you think of a version control system as keeping track of *changes*, it might make more sense. Most people use `git add .` but `git add -A` can be safer. No matter what, `git status` is your friend.

    message "`-m \"Added all the things\"`  is just a shortcut to say what your commit message is. You can skip that part and git will bring up an editor to fill out a more detailed message."

By checking your application into git now, you're creating a record of your starting point. Whenever you make a change during today's workshop, we'll add it to git before moving on. This way, if anything ever breaks, or you make a change you don't like, you can use git as an all-powerful "undo" technique. But that only works when you remember to commit early and often!
