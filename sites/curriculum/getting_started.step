  You can see that <code>rails new</code> created a lot directories and
  files. The ones we want to focus on today are:
  MARKDOWN

    tr {
      th "File/Folder"
      th "Purpose"

      td "This is where your images, JavaScript, stylesheets (CSS), and other static files should go. Modern rails apps use something called the Assets Pipeline, which combines all the JavaScript and CSS files in this directory into a single file for speediness."
