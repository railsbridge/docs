    message <<-HEROKU_TOPICS
Open your heroku app in the browser again by typing `heroku open`, then add "topics" to the end of the url. So if your app is called at `http://fierce-meadow-4845.heroku.com/` it should look lile `http://fierce-meadow-4845.heroku.com/topics`

You should see a page that looks shockingly similar to the one you had locally. Test that you can create new topics on Heroku. When you've had enough fun, move on.

  message <<-MARKDOWN
  * We've done the 'git' steps before, so we won't go over that again...

  * `heroku rake` executes a rake task on your server, in this case,
    `db:migrate`, just like you did locally.
