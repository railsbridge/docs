## Other Tools to help you learn Ruby

### ri

ri is a tool to look up ruby documentation:

    $ ri String.split
    = String.split

    (from ruby core)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      str.split(pattern=$;, [limit])   => anArray

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Divides str into substrings based on a delimiter, returning an array of
    these substrings.
    ...

important "If running ri doesn't work and you've installed ruby using rvm, try
running this command first:

    $ rvm docs generate
"

You can do a lot with it:

* `ri Class` -- looks up the class documentation and shows all the methods available.
* `ri Class.method` -- looks up a specific method on a class or module.
* `ri method` -- searches all classes for matching methods

### irb

We've already introduced irb above, but it can't be stressed enough
that having an interactive live session with ruby is invaluable. You
can learn a lot from it.

You can do stuff like:

    $ irb
    >> "blah".methods
    => [:<=>, :==, :===, :eql?, :hash, :casecmp, :+, :*, :%, :[], :[]=, :insert, :length, :size...]

All of these methods are available for any string. You can then use
`ri` to look up the method documentation. It is a great way to find goodies!
