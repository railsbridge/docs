## Other Tools to help you learn Ruby

### ri
ri is a tool to look up ruby documentation. It lives on your computer, so if you're in a plane or underground bunker and can't get to google, all the information is right within the terminal! If you do prefer the internet, you can get the same information at [ruby-doc.org](http://ruby-doc.org).

    $ ri String.split
    = String.split

    (from ruby core)
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      str.split(pattern=$;, [limit])   => anArray

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Divides str into substrings based on a delimiter, returning an array of
    these substrings.
    ...

MARKDOWN

important "If running ri doesn't work and you've installed ruby using rvm, try running this command first:

    $ rvm docs generate
"

You can do a lot with it:

* `ri Class` -- looks up the class documentation and shows all the methods available
* `ri Class.method` -- looks up a specific method on a class or module
* `ri method` -- searches all classes for matching methods

### irb

We've already introduced irb above, but it can't be stressed enough that having an interactive live session with ruby is invaluable. You can learn a lot from it.

You can do stuff like:

    $ irb
    >> "blah".methods
    => [:<=>, :==, :===, :eql?, :hash, :casecmp...]

All of these methods are available for any string. You can then use `ri` to look up the method documentation. It is a great way to find goodies!
