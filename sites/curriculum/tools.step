## Other Tools to help you learn Ruby

### irb

We've already introduced irb above, but it can't be stressed enough
that having an interactive live session with ruby is invaluable. You
can learn a lot from it.

You can do stuff like:

    $ irb
    >> "blah".methods
    => [:<=>, :==, :===, :eql?, :hash, :casecmp, :+, :*, :%, :[], :[]=, :insert, :length, :size...]

All of these methods are available for any string. To find out more about what these methods do and how to use them, try searching for "String" on [ruby-doc.org](http://www.ruby-doc.org). It is a great way to find goodies!
