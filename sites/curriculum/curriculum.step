### Goal

To teach you Ruby on Rails you will use a "Real World"
example. You've decided to create a voting system for you and your
friends to play with. You've decided at a minimum, you'd like to
allow users to:

* view the topics sorted by number of votes
* vote on topics
* create, edit, and destroy topics

You've sketched up an initial screenshot of what you want it to look like:

![screenshot](img/finished_app.png)

### Meta-Goal

When you have completed today's goal of getting the basic
application online you should understand:

* Basic Ruby syntax
* How to try your Ruby code (irb)
* How to go from requirements to a new working Rails application
* How to get your application online
* The basic tools a RoR developer uses (editor, console, local server)

### Schedule

* 1-ish hour of ruby
* 4-ish hours of rails, broken up in 1-ish hour steps

This is just a rough guideline, not a mandate. Some steps you'll go
over and some you'll go under. It'll all work out by the end of the
day.

### Requirements

We're going to be working with:

* ruby 2.0.x
* rails 4.0.x
* bundler
* sqlite
* sublime text

Everything should be set up the night before during our
install-fest. Please ensure you have everything working _before_ you
show up for railsbridge on Saturday.

You can verify that you have everything working by trying this out in your terminal:
MARKDOWN

console_without_message("irb")
message("Now you are in irb")
irb_command "1+2", "=> 3", 'require "active_support"','=> true', 'exit'
message <<-MARKDOWN

If you can do that, you are probably good to go.

### Working Effectively and Efficiently

It is highly recommend you do the following:

* Bring up your terminal and open 3 tabs:
  * One is for regular terminal commands
  * One will be for irb or rails console. We'll explain later
  * One for the rails server
* Open your browser fresh or hide any windows you already have open.
  * Bring up one window with two tabs
    * One for this content
    * One for interacting with your app
* Open your text editor and do not close it
* Hide all extra applications. Turn off twitter, IM, and all other distractions

By minimizing the number of things you interact with, you reduce the
amount of time spent switching between them and the context lost as
you work through the lessons. Having 50 tabs open in your web
browser gets confusing and wastes time.

### Format

Each lesson will look like this:

<div style="background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 4em;">
  <h1 class="doc_title" style="margin-top: 0em;">Step Title</h1>
  <div class="goals">
    <h1>Goal:</h1>
    <p>Description of the current step.
    <p>Red because big goals are scary.
  </div>
  <div class="steps">
    <h1>Steps:</h1>
    <pre class="term">steps to take.</pre>
    <div class="console">
      <pre>
def code_to_write
  1 + 1
end</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Yellow because we've gotten it done, but we have no clue what's going on.
  </div>
  <div class="explanation">
    <h1>Explanation</h1>
    <p>Details of what the steps actually did... spell out the cause and effect.
    <p>Green because we can tie everything together now.
  </div>
</div>
