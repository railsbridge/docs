* `generate scaffold` tells rails to create everything necessary to get up and running with topics.
* `topic` tells rails the name of the new model.
* `title:string` says that topics have a title, which is a string.
* `description:text` says that topics have a description which is a "text". (We're befuddled by the difference too.)

  h2 "Rake"
  message <<-MARKDOWN
`rake` _(Ruby Make)_ is a tool that allows you to run small Ruby programs (**tasks**) that you use often in your application. Here, `rake db:migrate` is a task provided by the Rails framework.

You can run `rake -T` to see a list of all the `rake` commands your app currently responds to, along with a short description of each task.

  message "Rails implements a very specific notion of the **Model/View/Controller** pattern, which guides how you structure your web applications."

  h3 "Model"
  message <<-MARKDOWN
* saves data to the database
* accesses data from the database
* bridge between the database and objects
  MARKDOWN

  h3 "View"
  message <<-MARKDOWN
* display the data for human (or machine) consumption

  h3 "Controller"
  message <<-MARKDOWN
* acts as the glue between the models and the views
* combines data from multiple models
* summarizes and filters data
  MARKDOWN

  message <<-MARKDOWN
In MVC, models, views, and controllers have very specific jobs.  Separating responsibilities like this make it easy to maintain and extend rails applications.  When responsibilities become muddied it gets much harder to debug issues and add new functionality.
