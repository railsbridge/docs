# Extra Credit

If you got all the way through Suggestotron with some time to spare, here's some extra stuff you can try:

* Add a downvote button that does the opposite of what the upvote button does
* Sort topics by their number of votes

MARKDOWN

h1 "Authors"

ul do
  li "Sarah Allen"
  li "Sarah Mei"
  li "Alex Chaffee"
  li "Ryan Davis"
  li "Steven! Ragnarok"
  li "...and many, many others"
end

h1 "What next?"

ul do
  li "Probably time for the closing presentation." 
  li "After that, start a project, tutorial, and come back again!"
  li do 
    span "All our favorite resources can be found on the RailsBridge site: " 
    a "http://workshops.railsbridge.org/whats-next/", href: "http://workshops.railsbridge.org/whats-next/"
