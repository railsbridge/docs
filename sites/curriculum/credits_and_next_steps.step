Guess what?  _**You're done!!!**_ Congratulations, you just \"finished\" your first rails app!

(They're never _really_ ever finished... have fun tweaking it!)

# Extra Credit

If you got all the way through Suggestotron with some time to spare, here's some extra stuff you can try:

* Add a downvote button that does the opposite of what the upvote button does
* Sort topics by their number of votes
* Try some debugging

## Break it! Fix it!

How about you let your teacher break the app you just wrote? We guess you are asking yourself \"why would I do that?\".
Well, **debugging** is a big part of every developer's day.

**Debugging** is the process where you find the problem that causes your application to misbehave or to stop working altogether.
This is a special skill that you will develop throughout your programming career and is hardly ever learnt from a book. It
takes time, patience, and hard work to improve your debugging skill.

The exercises below will give you a sneak peek of how the debugging process is usually done. Call a teacher and let\'s take a look at three fragile points of every Rails application:
MARKDOWN
ol do
  li "Attributes in the attr_accessible collection"
  li "Routes"
  li "Bugs that cause unwanted behaviour, but don\'t cause the app to crash "
end
