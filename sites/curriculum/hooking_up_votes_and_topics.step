`has_many` and `belongs_to`:

* In rails, relationships between models are called associations.
* Associations (usually) come in pairs.
* A topic will have many votes so we put `has_many :votes` in the
  topic model.
  * When you ask a topic for its votes, you get an array of votes
    for that topic.
* A vote is for a particular topic, so we put `belongs_to :topic`
  in the vote model.
  * When you ask a vote for its topic, you get the topic for that
    vote.

It can still be important to clean up after yourself! `dependent: :destroy`
  on `has_many :votes` means when a **Topic** gets destroyed, all
  the **votes** that correspond to it will be destroyed, too. Without
  `dependent :destroy`, those votes would live on the database forever.
