explanation {

 message <<-MARKDOWN
  * `root :to => 'topics#index'` is a rails route that says the default
    address for your site is `topics#index`. `topics#index` is the topics
    list page (the topics controller with the index action).
  * Rails routes control how URLs (web addresses) get matched with
    code on the server. Similar to how addresses match with houses and
    apartments.
  * The file `config/routes.rb` is like an address directory listing the
    possible addresses and which code goes with each one
  * `routes.rb` uses some shortcuts so it doesn't always show all the
    possible URLs. To explore the URLs in more detail we can use the
    terminal.

  At the terminal type `rake routes`. You should get something that
  looks like this:

  ````
    $ rake routes

         votes GET    /votes(.:format)           votes#index
               POST   /votes(.:format)           votes#create
      new_vote GET    /votes/new(.:format)       votes#new
     edit_vote GET    /votes/:id/edit(.:format)  votes#edit
          vote GET    /votes/:id(.:format)       votes#show
               PUT    /votes/:id(.:format)       votes#update
               DELETE /votes/:id(.:format)       votes#destroy
        topics GET    /topics(.:format)          topics#index
               POST   /topics(.:format)          topics#create
     new_topic GET    /topics/new(.:format)      topics#new
    edit_topic GET    /topics/:id/edit(.:format) topics#edit
         topic GET    /topics/:id(.:format)      topics#show
               PUT    /topics/:id(.:format)      topics#update
               DELETE /topics/:id(.:format)      topics#destroy
          root        /                          topics#index
  ````
  This shows all the URLs your application responds to. The code that starts with colons are variables so :id means the id number of the record. The code in parenthesis is optional.

### Exploring Routes (optional)

  Now you can have a look at the paths that are available in your app.
  Let's try looking at one of the topics routes we just generated.
  Open up your rails console and play:

    $ rails console
    >> app.topics_path
    => "/topics"
    >> app.topics_url
    => "http://www.example.com/topics"

  `app` is a special object that represents your entire application.
  You can ask it about its routes (as we just did), play with its
  database connections, or make pseudo-web requests against it with
  `get` or `post` (and lots more).
