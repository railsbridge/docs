  message <<-MARKDOWN
  * `format.html do redirect_to topics_path, notice: 'Topic was successfully created.' end`:
    * `format.html` means that the server should send html back to the browser
    * `redirect_to topics_path` means show the **topics list page** when we're done creating a topic
    * `notice: 'Topic was successfully created.'` puts the message into the flash so it will be displayed on the topics list
